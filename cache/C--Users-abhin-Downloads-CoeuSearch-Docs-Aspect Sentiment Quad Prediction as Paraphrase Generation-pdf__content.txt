Introduction ﬁne-grained opinion mining problem , aspect- based sentiment analysis ( ABSA ) aims anal- yse sentiment information aspect level ( Liu ,      ; Pontiki et al. ,      ) .

Given example sentence “ pasta over-cooked ! ” , senti- ment elements “ food quality ” , “ pasta ” , “ over- cooked ” , “ negative ” , respectively . Due broad application scenarios , many re- search efforts made ABSA predict extract sentiment elements ( Pontiki et al. ,      ,      ,      ) . Early studies focus pre- diction single element aspect term extraction ( Liu et al. ,      ; Xu et al. ,      ) , as- pect category detection ( Zhou et al. ,      ) , aspect sentiment classiﬁcation based either aspect category ( Ruder et al. ,      ; Hu et al. ,     a ) aspect term ( Huang Carley ,      ) . recent works propose extract multiple associated sentiment elements time ( Zhang et al. ,      ) . example , Chen et al . (      ) consider aspect opinion term pairwise extraction ; Peng et al . (      ) propose aspect sentiment triplet extraction ( ASTE ) task detect ( aspect term , opinion term , sentiment polarity ) triplets ; Wan et al . (      ) handle target aspect sentiment detection ( TASD ) task jointly detects aspect category , aspect term , sentiment polarity . Despite popularity , ABSA tasks attempt perform partial prediction instead providing complete aspect-level sentiment pic- ture , i.e. , identifying four sentiment elements one shot . end , introduce aspect sentiment quad prediction ( ASQP ) task , aiming predict ( aspect category , aspect term , opinion term , sentiment polarity ) quads given opinion- ated sentence . new task compensates drawbacks previous tasks helps us compre- hensively understand user ’ aspect-level opinions . tackle ASQP , one straightforward idea decouple quad prediction problem sev- eral sub-tasks solve pipeline manner . However , multi-stage approaches would suffer severely error propagation overall          c    ] L C .  c [   v           .         : v  X r        prediction performance hinges accuracy every step ( Peng et al. ,      ; Chen et al. ,      ) . Besides , involved sub-tasks , usually formulated either token-level sequence-level classiﬁcation problems , underutilize rich se- mantic information label ( i.e. , meaning sentiment elements predicted ) since treat labels number indices training . Intuitively , aspect term “ pasta ” unlikely coupled aspect category “ service gen- eral ” due large semantic gap . information suitably utilized classiﬁcation-type methods . Inspired recent success formulating vari- ous NLP tasks text generation problems ( Athi- waratkun et al. ,      ; Paolini et al. ,      ; Liu et al. ,      ) , propose tackle ASQP sequence- to-sequence ( S S ) manner paper . one hand , sentiment quads predicted end-to-end manner , alleviating potential error propagation pipeline solutions . hand , rich label semantic information could fully exploited learning generate senti- ment elements natural language form . Exploiting generation modeling ASQP task mainly faces two challenges : ( ) lin- earize desired sentiment information facilitate S S learning ? ( ii ) utilize pretrained models tackling task , common practice solving various ABSA tasks ( Xu et al. ,      ; Cai et al. ,      ) ? handle two challenges , propose novel PARA- PHRASE modeling paradigm , transforms ASQP task paraphrase generation problem ( Bhagat Hovy ,      ) . Speciﬁcally , ap- proach linearizes sentiment quad natu- ral language sentence paraphrasing input sentence highlighting major sen- timent elements . example , transform aforementioned sentiment quad ( food quality , pasta , over-cooked , negative ) sentence “ Food quality bad pasta over-cooked ” . linearized target sequence , paired input sentence “ pasta over-cooked ! ” used learn mapping function genera- tion model . seamlessly utilize large pretrained generative models T  ( Raffel et al. ,      ) ﬁne-tuning input-target pairs . Therefore , rich label semantics sentiment elements naturally fused rich knowledge pretrained models form natural sentences , rather directly treating desired sentiment quad text sequence generation target ( Zhang et al. ,      ) . summarize contributions follows :   ) study new task , namely aspect sentiment quad prediction ( ASQP ) work introduce two datasets sentiment quad annotations sample , aiming analyze comprehensive aspect-level sentiment information .   ) propose tackle ASQP paraphrase generation problem , predict sentiment quads one shot fully utilize semantics information natu- ral language labels .   ) Extensive experiments show proposed PARAPHRASE modeling effec- tive tackle ASQP well ABSA tasks , outperforming previous state-of-the-art models cases .   ) experiment also suggests PARAPHRASE method naturally facilitates knowledge transfer across related tasks uniﬁed framework , especially beneﬁ- cial low-resource setting.    Related Work ABSA extensively studied recent years main research line extraction sentiment elements . Early studies focus prediction single element extracting aspect term ( Liu et al. ,      ; Yin et al. ,      ; Xu et al. ,      ; et al. ,      ) , detecting men- tioned aspect category ( Zhou et al. ,      ; Bu et al. ,      ) , predicting sentiment polarity , given either aspect term ( Wang et al. ,      ; Huang Carley ,      ; Zhang Qian ,      ) as- pect category ( Ruder et al. ,      ; Hu et al. ,     a ) . works consider joint detection two sentiment elements , including pairwise extraction aspect opinion term ( Wang et al. ,      ; Chen et al. ,      ; Zhao et al. ,      ) ; prediction aspect term corresponding sen- timent polarity ( Li et al. ,     a ; et al. ,      ; Hu et al. ,     b ; Luo et al. ,      ; Chen Qian ,      ) ; co-extraction aspect category sentiment polarity ( Cai et al. ,      ) . recently , triplet prediction tasks pro- posed ABSA , aiming predict sentiment elements triplet format . Peng et al .

Built top tasks , introduce aspect sentiment quad prediction problem , aiming pre- dict four sentiment elements one shot , provide detailed comprehensive sentiment structure given text . Adopting pretrained transformer-based models BERT ( Devlin et al. ,      ) become common practice tackling ABSA problem . Especially , many ABSA tasks beneﬁt appro- priately utilizing pretrained models . Sun et al .

Results Discussions  .  Main Results result ASQP task reported Table   . notable observations : Firstly , performance pipeline methods far satisfactory . Although adopting BERT backbone , uniﬁed methods ( e.g. , TASO-BERT- Linear ) perform much better pipeline ones ( e.g. , HGCN-BERT + BERT-Linear ) . veriﬁes assumption pipeline solutions tend accumulate errors sub-task models ﬁnally affect performance ﬁnal quad prediction . Secondly , among uniﬁed methods , GAS outperforms two variants TASO large margin , showing effectiveness sequence- to-sequence modeling ASQP task . Besides , solve task uniﬁed manner , TASO ex- pands dataset |Vc| × |Vp| times original size , leading large computation costs train- ing time . Thirdly , see proposed method , PARAPHRASE modeling achieves best performance metrics across two datasets . method tackles ASQP problem end-to-end manner , alleviating possible error propagation pipeline solutions . Moreover , compared GAS method using pre-trained model , PARAPHRASE also achieves superior results , suggesting constructing target sequence natural language form better way utiliz- ing knowledge pre-trained generative model , thus leading better performance .  .

Speciﬁcally , instead mapping label natural language form projection func- tions introduced Sec  .  , map label special symbol , similar number index classiﬁcation-type models , representing label class . consider three cases : (   ) w/o sen- timent polarity semantics : Pp ( pi ) = SPi pi sentiment polarity , denotes index . example , map positive class SP  ; (   ) w/o aspect category semantics : Pc ( cj ) = ACj project aspect category cj symbol index j  . instance , aspect category “ food quality ” mapped AC  ; (   ) w/o polarity & category semantics : considers two cases meaning aspect category sentiment polarity removed . results presented lower part Ta-  The mapping relation category in- dexes pre-deﬁned based entire dataset .
