OPEN Potential biomarkers and immune  characteristics of small bowel  adenocarcinoma Jinggao Feng*, Xiayu Tang, Liusong Song, Zhipeng Zhou, Yuan Jiang & Yao Huang Small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) is a gastrointestinal malignancy with low incidence but poor  prognosis, and its pathogenesis is still unclear. This study aimed to explore potential disease-causing  biomarkers of SBA. The gene expression datasets of SBA and normal samples were downloaded from  the Gene Expression Omnibus database. First, differential gene expression analysis and weighted  gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) were performed. Common genes (CGs) were obtained  by intersection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and optimal modal genes of WGCNA.  Subsequently, a protein‒protein interaction network was established to screen hub genes, and  target genes were obtained by Lasso regression analysis of hub genes. An SBA risk prediction model  was established based on target genes. The prediction accuracy of the model was evaluated by the  area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The levels of immune cell infiltration  and activation of immune pathways were compared between SBA and normal samples using the  "ggpubr" and "reshape2" packages. A total of 1058 DEGs were identified. WGCNA showed that the  signature gene in the brown module was significantly associated with SBA (p = 7E−17), and 469 CGs  were obtained. Four target genes (APOA4, APOB, COL1A2, FN1) were identified and showed excellent  prediction of SBA risk (AUC = 0.965). In addition, active dendritic cells and macrophages showed  higher infiltration levels in SBA. Meanwhile, the APC_co_stimulation pathway and parainflammation  pathway were strongly active in SBA. Four target genes (APOA4, APOB, COL1A2, FN1) may be  involved in the pathogenesis of small bowel adenocarcinoma. As a rare tumor, small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) accounts for only 3–5% of digestive malignant tumors1.  In 2021, there were 11,390 new cases of SBA in the United States and 2100 deaths from the disease2. Because of  the nonspecificity of SBA symptoms, the diagnosis is often due to intestinal perforation, ileus, and uncontrolled  gastrointestinal bleeding. Therefore, approximately one-third of patients are diagnosed with distant metastasis3.  Meanwhile, the prognosis of SBA is poor, especially for patients in an advanced stage4,5. Currently, the understanding of the pathogenesis of SBA is still limited. The traditional concept is that the  pathogenesis of SBA is similar to that of colon cancer but lacks exact evidence. Several key molecular drivers  in the pathogenesis of SBA have been identified by genomic profiling studies, including TP53, SMAD4, KRAS  and E-cadherin6,7. Fortunately, many studies have reported that the incidence of high microsatellite instability  (MSI-H) or dMMR and high tumor mutational burden (TMB) in SBAs is higher than that in gastric cancer and  colorectal cancer, suggesting that immunotherapy may be a new therapeutic breakthrough8–10. However, the state  of immune cell infiltration and immune pathway activation in the immune microenvironment in SBA is still  unclear. Hereditary cancer syndromes such as Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis and Peutz‒Jegh- ers syndrome are considered to be risk factors for SBA11,12. In addition, patients with Crohn’s disease and celiac  disease are more likely to suffer from SBA13,14. To date, few studies on potential biomarkers of SBA have been recorded. In this study, comprehensive bio- informatics methods were utilized to explore the pathogenesis of SBA and screen biomarkers that may have  therapeutic value. Meanwhile, the tumor immune microenvironment of SBA was discussed. Methods Patient and public involvement.

Our study is based on open source data, so there are no ethical issues or  other conflicts of interest. The statistical analysis of this study was completed by R version 4.1.0 (http:// www.r- proje ct. org). P < 0.05  on both sides was considered statistically significant. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (https://  www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/ geo/) was used to download the gene expression dataset for SBA pathological tissues  and normal small bowel mucosa samples15. Data preprocessing was performed on the dataset using the "limma"  and "impute" packages, including conversion of probe names to gene names, missing value filling and data   normalization16. Deleted data with unrecognized gene names. Genes satisfying FDR < 0.01 and |log2 -fold change  (FC)|> 2 were selected through the "limma" package, and these genes were designated differentially expressed  genes (DEGs)17. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to explore the interaction between DEGs.  The gene coexpression network was constructed by the "WGCNA" package18. First, genes with more than 25%  variation between samples were introduced into WGCNA. Second, the soft threshold was calculated by the  pickSoftThreshold function, and RsquaredCut was set to 0.919. The best soft threshold was chosen, and the  adjacency matrix was calculated. Then, the adjacency matrix was converted into a topological overlap matrix  (TOM), and the degree of dissimilarity between genes was calculated. Third, gene modules were divided using  the dynamic shear tree, the minimum gene module size was set to 50, and then the modules with a dissimilarity  coefficient less than 0.2 were merged20. Fourth, we selected the module associated with clinical traits, calculated  the relationship between genes and traits and modules, and then visualized the characteristic gene network.  The intersection genes between DEGs and genes in important modules were defined as common genes (CGs). CGs were uploaded to the DAVID database (https:// david. ncifc rf. gov/ tools. jsp) and KOBAS database (http://  kobas. cbi. pku. edu. cn/ genel ist/), and the significantly enriched Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Ency- clopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis results were exported, and the results were visualized21,22. In  addition, CGs were imported into the STRING database (https:// www. string- db. org/)23, protein‒protein interac- tion (PPI) networks were built, the minimum required interaction score was set to 0.9, the results were exported,  and Cytoscape Version 3.8.2 was applied to visualize the PPI network24. The CytoHubba plug-in in Cytoscape  was used to calculate the degree of each CG node and screen out the top 10 hub genes25. The "glmnet" package was used for logistic LASSO regression analysis of hub genes, and hub genes with a  strong correlation to the risk of SBA were obtained and defined as target genes26. The "rms" package was used  to draw the nomogram of the model for predicting SBA risk based on the above hub genes27. A receiver operat- ing characteristic (ROC) curve was obtained by the "ROCR" package28. ROC curves were used to evaluate the  prediction accuracy of the model. The levels of immune cell infiltration and activation of the immune pathway in the SBA and control groups  were analyzed by using the "ggpubr" and "reshape2" packages, respectively. In addition, the "corrplot" package  was used to explore the relationships between immune cells and between immune pathways. The miRTarBase, StarBase and TargetScan databases were used to predict the microRNAs (miRNAs) of   CGs29–31. The miRNAs obtained from the three databases were intersected to obtain the target miRNAs. On the  other hand, CGs were imported into the Enrichr database (https:// maaya nlab. cloud/ Enric hr/)32, and transcrip- tion factors (TFs) targeting CGs with p < 0.01 were screened out to obtain the TF-mRNA regulatory network.  The above regulatory networks were visualized by Cytoscape. Ethical approval and consent to participate. The Ethics Committee of The Central Hospital of Yong- zhou reviewed the study, and ethics approval was not necessary. Results Identification of DEGs. After filtering, one dataset (GSE61465) was downloaded from the GEO database.  By analyzing the expression levels of genes in the above dataset, 1058 DEGs were obtained, of which 383 were  upregulated and 675 were downregulated. Identification of gene coexpression networks and modules. First, 25% (5182) of the genes with  the largest variance were extracted for subsequent analysis. Second, we defined the threshold to 50 for cluster  analysis. Third, R2 was set to 0.9, and the best soft threshold was 6. Fourth, genes with a dissimilarity coefficient  less than 0.2 were combined to obtain 11 modules, and the genes in each module had similar coexpression traits  (Fig. 1A). Eleven modules were randomly distinguished by color. The characteristic gene (ME) in the brown  module (r = − 0.9; p = 7E−17) showed the highest positive correlation and the most significant correlation with  SBA (Fig.  1B). Meanwhile, there was a significant positive relationship between the module members of the  genes (MMs, the correlation between specific genes and the characteristic genes of the module) in the brown  module and the gene significance (GSs, the correlation between specific genes and clinical variables). A signifi- cant correlation (cor = 0.94, P < 1E−200) was observed, as shown in Fig. 1C. Finally, the DEGs and the genes in  the brown module were intersected to obtain CGs (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, the brown module was determined to  be the key module of SBA, and 653 genes contained in the module were used for the next analysis. The number  of genes in each analysis phase is shown in Table 1. Enrichment analyses of the common genes and hub genes.  In biological processes (BP), CGs  were mainly enriched in "xenobiotic metabolic process", "retinoid metabolic process", "proteolysis", "fatty acid  beta-oxidation" and "retinol metabolic process". CGs are mainly involved in the cell component (CC) ontology,  including "extracellular exosome", "apical plasma membrane", "extracellular region", "brush border membrane"  and "endoplasmic reticulum lumen". In molecular function (MF), CGs were mostly enriched in "extracellular  Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:16204 |  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-20599-5 2 Vol:.(1234567890)www.nature.com/scientificreports/Figure 1.

In addition,  T regulatory (Treg) cell infiltration was positively correlated with T helper cell infiltration. The check-point  pathway was positively correlated with the T_cell_co-inhibition pathway and T_cell_co-stimulation pathway,  as shown in Fig. 4B. Figure 4C,D show the level of immune cell infiltration and activation of immune pathways  in the SBA and control groups, respectively. Compared with the control group, the infiltration levels of B cells,  CD8+-T cells, DCs, mast cells, NK cells, type 1  T helper (Th1) cells and TILs were lower in SBA. However,  active dendritic cells (aDCs) and macrophages showed higher infiltration levels in SBA. Meanwhile, in the con- trol group, the activation of the APC_co_inhibition pathway, Check-point pathway, Cytolytic_activity pathway,  Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) pathway, T_cell_co-inhibition pathway, T_cell_co-stimulation pathway and  Type_I_IFN_Response pathway was stronger than that of SBA. Activation of the APC_co_stimulation pathway  and the parainflammation pathway of SBA was stronger than that of the control group. Target miRNAs and TF‐mRNA regulatory network analysis.

Meanwhile, 8 TFs (NFIA, KLF13, MXI1, CACYBP, NFE2, SREBF2, KLF4, NR5A2) that  may be involved in the pathogenesis of SBA are shown in Fig. 5B. Discussion SBA is a malignant tumor with low incidence but poor prognosis. In this study, the messenger RNAs (mRNAs),  miRNAs and TFs that may be associated with its occurrence were predicted using a comprehensive bioinformat- ics analysis. Meanwhile, the SBA risk prediction model based on hub genes with good prediction accuracy was  established. Finally, analysis of the tumor immune microenvironment suggested that the invasion level of most  immune cells in SBA was low, and the activation intensity of the immune pathway was weak, which might be  the cause of tumor progression. Hub genes have attracted extensive attention as potential drug targets. In this study, four hub genes (APOA4,  APOB, COL1A2, FN1) were found to be significantly related to the pathogenesis of SBA. Apolipoprotein A4  (APOA4) encodes apolipoprotein A-IV, which is hydrolyzed and glycosylated to produce acidic glycoproteins  mainly found in chylomicrons (CMs), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and high-density lipoprotein  (HDL)33–35. It plays an important role in lipid transport and metabolism, especially in cholesterol reversal36.  Recent studies showed that APOA4 was significantly overexpressed in Helicobacter pylori-infected atrophic  gastritis and intestinal metaplasia tissues, as well as gastric cancer tissues37. Furthermore, APOA4 is consid- ered a diagnostic marker for colorectal cancer38,39. As a metabolic gene, apolipoprotein B (APOB) is the most  important apolipoprotein on chylomicrons and low-density lipoprotein40,41. APOB has been confirmed to be  associated with the pathogenesis of a variety of gastrointestinal malignancies, including liver cancer, gallbladder  cancer, esophageal cancer and pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma42–45. Abdominal obesity has been identified as  a risk factor for SBA46. In this study, APOA4 and APOB were significantly downregulated in SBA, suggesting  that lipid metabolism disorders may play an important role in the occurrence of SBA. In addition, functional  enrichment analysis showed that CGs were enriched in multiple metabolically related pathways. Unfortunately,  no studies have been found on APOA4 or APOB and SBA. Therefore, further research is necessary to clarify the  role of lipid metabolism in SBA. Collagen, Type I, Alpha 2 (COL1A2) is distributed in collagen and cytoplasm and is involved in bone develop- ment and the signal transduction pathway of transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase47,48. COL1A2 was  confirmed to be significantly overexpressed in gastric cancer tissues49–51. Similarly, COL1A2 was believed to be  significantly overexpressed in colorectal cancer tissues and blood samples, but the specific mechanism remains   unclear52,53. Increasing evidence shows that COL1A2 is considered to be a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker  due to its significant upregulation in many cancers54–56. In contrast, COL1A2 was significantly downregulated  in bladder cancer, malignant melanoma and head and neck cancer57–59. In this study, COL1A2 was significantly  overexpressed in SBA. Fibronectin 1 (FN1) is a glycoprotein distributed in the extracellular matrix and plays an  important role in carcinogenesis and metastasis60–62. FN1 expression was upregulated by the transcription factor  CP2, which is involved in the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma63. FN1 promotes ovarian cancer metastasis  by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway64. High expression of FN1 has been shown to be carcinogenic in esophageal   cancer65. In addition, FN1, as an oncogene, is involved in aggressive and poor prognosis of colon cancer66. As  Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:16204 |  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-20599-5 6 Vol:.(1234567890)www.nature.com/scientificreports/expected, high expression of FN1 was significantly associated with poorer prognosis of gastric cancer67,68. This  study suggests that the highly expressed FN1 plays an important role in the carcinogenesis of SBA. As innate immune cells, macrophages play an important role in the tumor microenvironment. High  macrophage infiltration has been associated with tumor progression or poor prognosis in a variety of solid  tumors, including neck squamous cell carcinoma, gliomas, breast cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and   melanoma69–74. Conversely, high macrophage infiltration was associated with a better prognosis of gastrointestinal  malignancies, such as gastric cancer and colorectal cancer75. This study suggested that the level of macrophage  infiltration in SBA was low, which may be one of the reasons for the poor prognosis of SBA. In addition, the low  infiltration of most immune cells and the weak activation of immune pathways may be important factors for the  occurrence and progression of SBA. Although the present study is novel and rigorous, there are still some shortcomings. First, the data used in  this study were obtained from a common public database, and because of the low prevalence of SBA, we were  unable to collect sufficient samples for experiments to validate the results of this study. Second, due to the lack of  prognostic information on SBA, our study could not be further investigated in the context of prognosis. In view  of this, we hope that more studies in the future will further validate our results and investigate them in depth. In conclusion, four mRNAs (APOA4, APOB, COL1A2, FN1) were predicted to be associated with the occur- rence of SBA, and an excellent SBA risk prediction model was established based on these genes. Meanwhile,  in SBA, it is speculated that the infiltration level of immune cells was low and the activation state of immune  pathways was weak. Finally, TFs and miRNAs that may be involved in the pathogenesis of SBA were predicted. Discussion This study predicted that four target mRNAs (APOA4, APOB, COL1A2, FN1) might be involved in the occur- rence and progression of SBA. In addition, low infiltration of immune cells and weak activation of immune  pathways may be immunological characteristics of SBA.
