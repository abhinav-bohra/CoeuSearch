Since key interventions Appadurai (      ) , Kopytoff (      ) Thomas (      ) , commodity analysis become fair game non-Marxists . human geography , example , veritable explosion research ‘ commodity chains ’ ( Leslie Reimer ,      ) , ‘ social geography things ’ ( Jackson ,      :     ) commodity ‘ displacements ’ ( Cook Crang ,      ) . theoretical terms , commodity analyses largely post- non-Marxist  attempted ‘ decouple ’ concept commodification traditional , negative rather exclusive associations – courtesy successive Marxists – capitalism fetishism . good , least focused attention total sociogeographic trajectory commodities.  However , unfortunate consequence meanings ‘ commodification ’ greatly multiplied many commodity analysts apparently believe one ‘ essential ’ Marxist notion capitalist commodification opposed , criticized eclipsed . , though Appadurai , Kopytoff Thomas quite right ‘ capitalist ’ ‘ non-capitalist ’ commodities rarely disentangled practice , still arguably important identify analytically distinct attributes things take capitalist phase commodity existence . Though capitalism may all-pervasive Marxists wont argue , remains manifestly consequential way making , moving selling manner goods services . continued value Marxism , seems , inquire specificity capitalism myriad effects – even acknowledge overdetermination within wider sets process , relations events . said , Marxists monopoly analysis capitalism ( Saunders ,      ) , certainly made prime focus analytical energies , process muddying waters theoretical depiction ‘ real ’ nature ( Gibson-Graham ,      ) . human geography cognate fields , study society- nature relationships one topic areas Marxism retained strong intellectual presence recent years ( Castree ,      ; ’ Connor ,      ; Swyngedouw ,      ) . means set elaborated arguments available help academic Left understand distinctiveness capitalist appropriations things conventionally call ‘ natural ’ . explicitly implicitly , commodifica- tion nature within capitalist societies central theme Marxian research . Indeed , compared contemporary commodity analysts human geography , Marxist persuasion given ‘ natural ’ dimensions commodities perhaps greatest attention . However , herein lies potential confusion : want show contemporary Marxist analysts capitalist-nature relationships refer several linked necessarily synonymous things use term commodification – variations putative ‘ core ’ conception supplied Marx principal epigones . assumption one Marxian ‘ essential ’ reading capitalist commodifi- cation therefore misplaced . critics devotees Marxism accept fact capitalist commodification means several things attempt scrutinize separately rather assimilate overarching conception . Whether diversity reflects sheer complexity capitalist commodification simply Noel Castree     unresolved debates among Marxists open question . brings third reason writing essay second three difficult questions . ‘ Nature ’ , Neil Smith (      :    ) observed , ‘ . . . much Marxist category ’ . may well right , Marxists must perforce use signify certain living inanimate things ( even things acknowledged concept naming ) . , physical properties things evidently important . , Marxists would pay special attention commodification within capitalist societies . commodification would , words , considered substantively equivalent ‘ non-natural ’ entities . However , Thrift (      :    ) rightly notes , ‘ commodities equal ’ .  matters part argument contemporary Marxists analysing nature ’ commodification referring rather different sets things use portmanteau category ‘ nature ’ .  attention qualitative differences among so-called ‘ natural ’ entities salutary , part , quite conscious part Marxists whose work consider . concern , though , differences easily glossed one category ‘ nature ’ used shorthand refer substantively different things . need recognize simply materiality nature irreducible materialities natures , plural ( cf .

Finally , explains desire explore conjunction explanation critique Marxian work consider essay – , desire address third difficult questions . Marxism , course , many contemporary per- mutations , regards ‘ critical ’ paradigm . Indeed , academic Left generally taken keen interest commodification recent years implied sense aspects process deemed ‘ wrong ’ ‘ bad ’ range commentators extend beyond Marxists alone . However , successive treatises show ( Benhabib ,      ; McCarney ,      ; Sayer ,      : part IV ) , meaning critique anything obvious simple . wish focus Marxists evaluate commodification nature capitalist societies . Clearly , extent Marxists refuse affirm celebrate nature ’ commodification inter alia reservations . reservations , apropos comments previous paragraph , somehow bound-up material differences among commodities strong ‘ natural ’ component . Thus , nature might much Marxist category , , normatively speaking , strategically useful far names real things whose commodification deemed problematic .

However , argue precise form Marxists ’ reservations frequently implicit . unfortunate much keeping long-standing Marxian habit ( geography elsewhere ) avoiding systematic normative theorizing . unclear exactly capitalist commodifi- cation specific natures objectionable , Marxism ’ critical edge evidently     Commodifying nature ? blunted .

Overall , focusing Marxist theorizations capitalism , nature commodification hope address two audiences : first , geographers specific research interests Marxism nature ; second , geographers wider interest commodification within beyond capitalism . Without formally differentiating modes commodification relation different Noel Castree     kinds things , audiences may remain destined talk past one another using terms concepts . II Capitalist commodification mentioned , heightened interest critical geographers commodification coincident proliferation term ’ meanings . However , one sense concept eminently clear useful Marxists non-Marxists alike . Along inelegant word ‘ commodization ’ , highlights fact commodity status thing , object , idea , creature , person what-have-you intrinsic , rather , assigned . Nicholas Thomas (      :    ) put book Entangled objects , term deconstructs ‘ essentialist notion identity material things fixed structure form ’ . Put differently , ‘ objects commodity status built ’ ( Dant ,      :    ) . question , therefore , ‘ commodity ? ’ rather ‘ kind characteristics things take-on become commodities ? ’ term commodification thus usefully connotes process state irreducible thing/s commodified nonetheless affects – may , reciprocally , affected ( Kopytoff ,      ) . Though Marxists remain eager specify ‘ essential ’ character capitalist commodification ( e.g. , Castree ,      ; Goddard ,      ) – usually way canonical references opening section Capital , volume   – , actuality , little consensus matter . Critics Marxism frequently overlook fact . example , otherwise persuasive manifesto less negative , less capital-centric perspective commodification , Cook Crang (      :     ) seem take Harvey ’ (      ) well-known call penetrate veils commodity fetishism emblematic Marxism tout court . Jackson ’ (      :   ) recent essay ‘ commercial cultures ’ much . problematic three reasons . First , risks essentializing Marxism distracting attention genuine theoretical differences among Marxist theorists – Harvey one . Second , also risks focusing ‘ non-capitalist ’ commodities perfectly clear – thus longer necessary consider – ‘ capitalist ’ commodities phase existence.  Finally , bulk post- non-Marxist commodity analysts critical geography related fields rarely paid attention ‘ natural ’ dimensions commodities , whether commodities putatively capitalist otherwise . Though notable exceptions ( e.g. , Whatmore Thorne ,      ) , analysts main concerned commodity symbolism identity politics . essay wetlands , Robertson (      :     ) recently argued term com- modification ‘ frequently [ used ] without definition ’ Marxists writing nature.  , think , right – wrong reasons . Robertson implies Marxists rather assumed meaning commodification obvious therefore troubled thematize overtly . contrast , would suggest con- temporary Marxists writing nature tease commodification distinct theme deeply interwoven wider theorization capitalism . Thus , John Frow (      :     ) commends ‘ Marxism ’ relational historical theoriza- tion commodity ’ arguably reacting – instance , Jon Elster analytical Marxists – would separate discrete thematic .     Commodifying nature ? shall see , Marxists considered essay adopt expansive perspective capitalist commodification . , though , raises question wish talk commodification . talk ‘ valuation nature ’ ( Harvey ,      : Chapter   ) , ‘ capitaliza- tion nature ’ ( M. ’ Connor ,      ) ‘ production nature ’ ( Smith ,      ) , authors whose work consider ? two reasons . First , whatever differences , Marxists discussed take axiomatic capitalist social relations necessarily take phenomenal form commodities . Put differently , , many believe , capitalism encroaching ‘ every nook cranny everyday , everynight life ’ ( Pred ,      :     ) Marxists whose work consider encroachment takes physical , tangible form commodities.   Second , recent non- post-Marxist work topic , term “ commodification ” usefully dynamic sharp-edged meanings . Leys (      :    ) puts , ‘ speak ‘ commodification ’ normally mind one-off sale single item , conversion whole class goods services commodities resulting stream sales ’ . commodification thematic thus draws attention process , therefore propriety , certain ontologically categorially distinct things seriously altered potential , temporary , permanent indeed ‘ denied ’ commodity status . examine commodification view capitalism-nature relationships especially illuminating window . section explore various meanings commodification within current Marxist literature nature . defer issue commodification affects natural entities specifically ( vice versa ) next section . cases see Marxists consider quality exchangeable – favoured Appadurai (      ) – thin basis specify entailed capitalist commodification . , form commodification historically particular , albeit practically entwined modes exchanging goods services ( gifts , loans , etc. ) . abstract level , authors see capitalist commodification process qualita- tively distinct things rendered equivalent saleable medium money . Particular commodity-bodies ( use values ) thus commensurated take general quality exchange value . said , principal source Marxists often thought draw upon inspiration – Marx ’ plenary account commod- ification , articulated Capital ’ opening pages – seems rather little nature ( except sense commodification people , labour power , bodily consequences ) . Instead , seems concerned social relations take peculiar form qualitatively different nonetheless exchangeable things ( commodities ) . Marx ’ principal intent , according several generations commenta- tors ( e.g. , Cleaver ,      ; Taussig ,      ) , show capitalism exchangeable goods nothing alien displaced form social labour . However , see several contemporary Marxists display healthy disregard canonical rectitude also tease things implicit absent Marx ’ later writings . , , principal elements commodification identified work contemporary Marxists writing nature ? Noel Castree       Privatization mentioned , authors whose work review consider money- mediated exchange distinctly different things part specificity capitalist commodification . However , within seemingly simple definition lie several differentia specifica , Marxists , distinguish capitalist non-capitalist commod- ification processes . shall see , specific elements unique capitalism considered isolation . Rather , combination gives capitalist colouration . first want highlight privatization.   Privatization refers assignation legal title named individual , group institution . title gives more-or-less exclusive rights owner dispose named title wish . Though privatization means feature capitalist societies alone , well-known Marxian axiom precondition capitalist commodification . reason exchange things either via money occur unless things belong different parties free alienate things . Privatization thus much control commodities – prior , exchange – ownership technical , legalistic sense . Examples contemporary Marxists emphasize privatization work nature ’ commodification hard find . Bakker (      ;      ) , research UK water industry , among explicit . largely work considers demise water state-managed ‘ public good ’ transformation sellable commodity owned several new water companies , like Yorkshire Water . Similarly , Jack Kloppenburg (      ) , landmark book First seed , emphasizes emergent seed companies twentieth-century America used law gain proprietary control hybrid crop varieties . Prior privatization efforts seeds either ‘ free good ’ among farmers else ‘ gift ’ US Department Agriculture part early ventures crop hybridization . Likewise , number Marxian studies ‘ Third World political ecology ’ accent legal physical conversion communal open-access resources private resources ( e.g. , Schroeder ,      ) . However , even writer ’ principal concern epochal transformation non-commodified commodified goods , question privati- zation looms large . instance , work Altvater (      ) James ’ Connor (      ) failure privatize nature privatizing things whose use directly affects nature , pace environmental economics , leads so-called ‘ market failures ’ . classic example atmospheric pollution , Benton (      ) calls ‘ naturally mediated unintended consequence ’ use certain private goods ( like cars ) .   Alienability Like privatization , alienability , , exclusive dimension capitalist com- modification . refers capacity given commodity , specific classes commodities , physically morally separated sellers . Privatization necessarily imply alienability . Thus , person may ‘ ’ internal organs mean society would sanction sale others need want . Likewise , indigenous community may ‘ ’ lay knowledge     Commodifying nature ? rare medicinal plants would necessarily sell pharmaceutical company . capitalist societies , according Marxists , commodity exchangeable via money must alienable . Otherwise , would shielded market exchange . rather pointless listing Marxists regard alienability key aspect capitalist commodification . axiomatic analyses rarely teased named facet . illustrative purposes , refer two contributions com- modification ‘ external ’ ‘ human ’ nature . analysis over-harvesting north Pacific fur seals , show res nullius resource rapidly became disposable property late nineteenth century . entailed physical dissociation seal skins seal bodies ( left rot Pribilof Islands ) , alienation former ( legal physical sense ) Bering Sea sealers furriers London . Dickens (      ) , account commodification human bodies , argues much . observes bodily components , like genes limbs , priced sold organic relationship people , indi- vidually collectively , biological ‘ owners ’ ( see Scheper-Hughes Wacquant ,      ) . cases , alienability possible commodity question physically ethically ‘ detached ’ seller .   Individuation Individuation linked , , privatization alienability . refers representational physical act separating specific thing entity supporting context . involves putting legal material boundaries around phenomena bought , sold used equally ‘ bounded ’ individuals , groups institutions ( like firm ) . privatization , capitalist commodity exchange simply possible unless commodities separated discrete ontological entities qualitative specificities . recalls Harvey ’ (      ) well-known argument , following Spoehr (      ) , counts individual resource matter convention sociotechnical achievement . involves discursive practical ‘ cut ’ seamless complexity world order name discrete ‘ noun-chunks ’ reality deemed socially useful . Likewise , counts commodity capitalist society socially determined entails arbitrary individuation certain things classes things . Elaine Hartwick (      ;      ) work gold commodity chains , illustrates well . analysis focuses gold qua gold long ago became well-spring entire industry legally , linguistically physically ring-fences specific incarna- tions precious metal ( rings , necklaces , etc . ) discrete entities monetary price attached . Likewise , Swyngedouw shows water histori- cally become separated socio-ecological integument capitalist societies . Similarly , Altvater (      :     ) makes much ‘ splitting complex ecosystems simplifies legally definable economically tradeable property rights ’ . One several examples Amazonian hardwoods , specific trees cut readily disembedded immediate ecological context plants , fungi , insects . Noel Castree       Abstraction Abstraction subtly different individuation . process whereby qualitative specificity individualized thing ( person , seed , gene what- have-you ) assimilated qualitative homogeneity broader type process . Following Cronon ’ (      : Chapter   ) stunning account commodification wheat Chicago ’ hinterland , Robertson (      :     ) identified two linked elements abstraction necessary capitalist commodification . first functional abstraction . Robertson shows study wetland commodification USA , involves individual wetlands labelled instanciations generic category ‘ wetlands ’ stands . Specifically , range generic ‘ wetland services ’ individual wetland provides catalogued ecologists , thus ‘ severing characteristic measured messy uniqueness physical site ’ ( Robertson ,      ) . functional abstraction involves looking real classifiable similarities otherwise distinct entities former separated latter unproblematically . Functional abstraction precondi- tion second form abstraction , spatial . involves individualized thing one place treated really apparently similar thing located elsewhere . Robertson illustrates well . Federal attempts conserve US wetlands , shows , involve trading loss wetlands places artificial creation others – trade-off monetarily costed . means , real physical sense , ‘ wetlands one place made replaceable wetlands another place ’ ( Robertson ,      : emphasis added ) individual wetlands involved somehow qualitatively regardless locational specificity .   Valuation question things take specific forms value – fourth aspect com- modification considered – gets us familiar Marxian territory . Marx , course , one key things characterizes capitalist commodities worth measured terms labour value – even though appears value intrinsic rather assigned . However , whether adhere labour theory value strict sense – – contemporary Marxists writing nature take axiomatic commodity valuation ‘ blind ’ social process capitalist societies distinct ‘ logic ’ . particular thing valued numerous ways simultaneously – ethically , practically , aesthetically . talk thing ’ ‘ use value ’ , ‘ existence value ’ ‘ functional value ’ , example ( Foster ,      ) . However , capitalist societies , expressions value manifested peculiarly colourless , contentless medium money . Capitalist commodities thus monetized : price , intents purposes , consequently rendered commensurable things taxonomic class goods different ones ( e.g. , money buy anything carbon credit medicinal plant alligator ) . reason Harvey (      : Chapter   ) , Justice , nature geography difference , dwells length way money becomes ultimate representation value capitalist societies . However , important fixate money alone ( cf . Robertson ,      :    –   ) . would focus market exchange isolation     Commodifying nature ? specific economic context . capitalist societies , context involves producing things conditions economic growth , technical innovation competition norms – predicated exploitation labour . words , money one ‘ moment ’ process producing wealth Marx called ‘ capital ’ . Neil Smith (      ) , Uneven development , explicit regarding called ‘ production nature ’ . emphasized commodities become mere means end accumulation accumulation ’ sake . Smith makes capitalist commodities commodities thus production , distribution exchange driven primarily profit imperative . , qualitative particularities notwithstanding , subject process requires earn rent producing selling . process generated , turn , conditions actions myriad distanciated proximate economic actors . effect , Kloppenburg (      ) Boyd (      ) – work commodification seeds chickens respectively – illustrate Smith ’ thesis empirical level . show ‘ natural ’ entities become physically altered ‘ way ’ suit profitability requirements agro-foods companies manufacture . Watts (      :     ) calls ‘ real subsumption ’ nature capitalist accu- mulation .   Displacement sixth final aspect capitalist commodification identified Marxists currently writing nature displacement . Displacement part parcel ‘ blind ’ process profit-driven commodity production sale described . leads fetishism famously described Marx , deconstruction geographical critics like Cook , Crang Jackson see much Marxist position commodification . Displacement something appearing , phenomenally , something . Put another way , involves one set phenomena manifesting way , paradoxically , occludes them.   relation nature , Elaine Hartwick (      ) perhaps done highlight displacements – geographical , temporal phenomenal – , view , part parcel capitalist commodification . Marx , Capital   , concerned ‘ penetrate veils ’ commodity exchange order disclose labour exploita- tion site production ( cf . Harvey ,      ) , Hartwick keen show happens nature site . Hartwick ’ point , like Marx ’ , spatiotem- poral separation commodity producers commodity consumers capitalism means latter ‘ see ’ ‘ contained ’ physical form commodities purchase . Hartwick ’ (      ) work gold , glitter precious metal necessary phenomenal form labour exploitation ecological degradation caused mining make visible . Capitalist commodities thus constitutively conceal intertwined process workers environment harmed systematically ( barring state intervention corporate restraint ) . follows commodities things , fact , socio-natural relations . Yet , Hartwick , mistake relations things fail see become alien power us . Noel Castree     various combinations , six aspects commodification , according Marxists whose work review , help us understand specific money-mediated exchange things capitalist societies . imply opposite archetype . instance , alienability implies non-alienability , individuation implies non-individuation , . ideal-typical ( neo-liberal ? ) world ‘ pure ’ capitalist commodification commodities would subject six aspects commodification highlighted without material moral resistance . aspects implied opposites rarely specified sextet individual author ’ work ( Robertson ,      , comes closest ) could , perhaps , easily brought within single interpretive frame . Regardless , indicate capitalist commodification complex , polymorphous process promiscuous space time . previously uncommodified things become subject specific form commodifica- tion , material ways , may change . turn , material change physical moral consequences people non-humans . However , grasp character import change need attend quite carefully exactly ‘ nature ’ commodified . III Commodifying natures one level may seem invidious try separate so-called ‘ natural ’ entities analytical consideration . , level commodities , capitalist otherwise , rooted aspects environment human body . However , least two good reasons Marxists ( others   ) sought move beyond rather banal sense nature figures acts commodification . first place , issue material specificities myriad things conventionally call natural . words , question whether commodifying specific things physical ethical consequences might altogether desirable . Colin Leys (      :     ) right ‘ every commodity particular char- acteristics give rise particular consequences course commodification ’ , clearly , important question . second place , entities call natural – including bodies – become commodities ( may , turn , cease commodities ) ; commodity status intrinsic result conscious unconscious actions people specific circumstances . flip-side focus materiality things commodified , draws attention material specifics commodification process ( subject previous section ) . Nature , course , weasel-word . Since key contributions Williams (      ) Smith (      ) , Marxists rarely used term literal , non-reflexive ways . Nonetheless , already seen still use shorthand refer astonishing variety things , wetlands ( Robertson ,      ) animals ( Castree ,      ) seeds ( Kloppenburg ,      ) . semantic promiscuity make hard understand whether specific natures question make difference – kind – capitalist commodification unfolds . Though Michael Watts (      :     ) right argue ‘ [ capitalist ] commodities physical properties ’ , miss something important ignore properties altogether . , distinguish four broad categories ‘ nature ’ appear Marxist     Commodifying nature ? writings commodification . degree Marxists fill content categories , shall see , depends much level theoretical abstraction working . Let stress aim scrutinize multifarious ideological work concept nature – Williams , Smith others already done that.   Rather , inquiring different ontological referents term nature literature surveyed . Clearly , matter determining whether Marxists attached term ‘ right ’ referents . Reference , course , matter convention . concern , , distinguish ontologi- cally things named term whose differences thereby risk overlooked unwary readers . Delaney (      :     ) puts , ‘ problem , simply regarding physicality “ nature ” , render multitudinous manifestations important . . . sense “ ” , even actual material referents shift ’ . issue whether materiality things choose call ‘ natural ’ matters – process commodification terms wider physical consequences.   Marxists , question materiality front-and-centre analysis . Notable George Henderson ’ (      ) magisterial work ‘ natural barriers ’ commodifying agriculture , builds germinal contribution Mann Dickinson (      ) . Marxists , contrast , materiality nature seems less issue ( see , example , Smith ,      ) . Let us , therefore , try identify natures ‘ matter ’ Marxists .   Nature external Many Marxists write nature-capital relations specific reference Smith (      ) called ‘ external nature ’ . non-human nature collective- ly call ‘ environment ’ . course , nature seen Marxists absolutely external . Harvey (      ) argued , non-human nature always defined relative specific societies utilize . Even ‘ human nature ’ – , body ( see section   ) – excluded , types nature one consider potentially endless . Contemporary Marxists , seems , considered two principal categories ‘ external nature ’ . Environmental inputs outputs – commodification effects : Environmental inputs  outputs feed directly , result production , capitalist commodities . environmental economists call ‘ externalities ’ found input output ends production process . James ’ Connor (      ) , Benton (      ) Altvater (      ) , perhaps , done emphasize ecological damage attendant upon commodification things others ( see also Webber ,      ) . ’ Connor ’ well-known thesis ‘ second con- tradiction capitalism ’ argues non-commodification ‘ conditions production ’ exposes indiscriminate secular degradation . Thus , single hardwood felled Amazon loss proximate flora fauna given economic value thus economically ‘ irrelevant ’ . Likewise , atmospheric pollution cars normally costed production sale prices . like , materiality commodification process ‘ ignores ’ material specifics Noel Castree     environmental inputs outputs exist matter . top , focus commodity displacement , apropos Hartwick , shows actual purchase consumption commodities fails make apparent ecological exter- nalities attendant production . environmental inputs outputs suffer b Environmental commodification : commodified – say , suffer collateral damage due things commodified – also consider direct commodification external nature . , ‘ pieces ’ environment become privatized , individuated , alienable . According M. ’ Connor (      ) Escobar (      ) , environment becoming directly commodified economic social costs non-commodification becoming apparent ( e.g. , acid deposition , ozone layer thinning , etc. ) . External nature , short , become ‘ accumulation strategy ’ capital ( Katz ,      :    ) . Bioprospecting ecotourism prominent recent examples , always true primary industries like mining agriculture . distinguish two types environmental commodification literature : ‘ real ’ ‘ proxy ’ . former , unlike latter , involve artificially fabricating market commodities question . Let us take turn . Bridge (      ) , take one many possible examples , illustrates real environmental commodification graphically research US copper industry . shows material contradictions arise external nature treated ‘ true ’ commodity : say , completely privatizable , alienable , separable , etc. , without remainder . contradictions affect nature commodification process . example , Bridge shows preference high-grade ores leads absolute depletion ( irreversible entropy increase ) also long-term rises production costs ( thus price copper ) . costs partly due large waste streams generated copper production , also raises social ecological issues waste disposed pay ( monetary sense ) . sense , Bridge ’ analysis recalls Polanyi ’ (      :    ) idea fictitious commodities ‘ detached rest life ’ . commodities partly commodifiable material form level ‘ resists ’ complete commodification . Thus , Harvey (      :     ) says something ‘ inherently anti-ecological ’ capitalist commodification , arguably highlighting contradictions materialities nature commodification process . Proxy commodification environment rather different real commodifica- tion . involves , , ‘ artificially ’ commodifying currently non-commodified entity set entities . language environmental economics , com- pensating ‘ missing markets ’ . Cost-benefit analysis contingent valuation exercises two well-known mechanisms achieving proxy commodification serve precursors creation real markets ( example , pollution permits ) . acts proxy commodification fall strictly six commod- ification criteria found Marxist work reviewed . example , putting monetary value world ’ biodiversity – Constanza et al . (      ) ( ) famously – obviously imply biodiversity alienable en masse literally individuated . However , cases – Kyoto carbon credit scheme – proxy commodification pave way real commodification     Commodifying nature ? six dimensions might play . Harvey (      :    –   ) one several Marxists strongly critical proxy commodification . Among things , observes monetary values placed things like ecosystem services completely arbitrary unable deal ‘ real ’ ecological value .   Nature internal distinction ‘ external ’ ‘ internal ’ nature slippery use heuristic . ‘ internal ’ nature mean nature human body – turn – circumstances nature brought firmly within commodification process . nature loses ‘ independent ’ capacity resist commodification approaches archetype ‘ pure ’ commodity described earlier . interesting Marxist work area done agriculture . , Marxists identified elements nature whose material intransigence overcome deliberately technological innovation . Kloppenburg ’ (      ) Boyd ’ (      ) research seeds chickens respectively excellent examples . commodification real rather merely formal types ‘ natural ’ entity lose naturalness become subject requirements production . Thus hybridization , genetic modification , use growth hormones become means ‘ designing ’ commodities – , ‘ producing ’ nature something like Smith ’ (      ) sense . However , internalization nature problem-free . , example , meet social resistance ( instance , farmers protesting pay seeds ) . Likewise , generate ‘ manufactured risks ’ , chicken flu , cattle , BSE . social ecological problems like Bridge ’ (      ) contradictions copper mining , thoroughly internal commodification process rather arising commodification ’ confrontation putatively external nature .   Nature human body Human bodies , course , purely natural . Butler (      ) Shilling (      ) , among others , shown human biology free cultural , social technical influence . Likewise , process theoretical abstraction one separate body physical thing identities personalities people ‘ inhabit ’ . distinguish ‘ human ’ external nature implying former domain pure , non-social physicality . Provisos aside , obvious reasons separate body special attention category ‘ nature ’ . material specifics body compared species inanimate parts nature . Humans , course , ‘ exceptional ’ phys- iological terms , notwithstanding close genetic anatomical relations simians . physiological specificity bound language skills , capacity emotion , psychological complexity . Accordingly , body typically treated morally sacrosanct societies : deserves – indeed receives – special analytical normative attention . Among things , long site heated debates limits placed ‘ market ’ Noel Castree     commodification . Chief among debates prostitution , surrogacy slavery . kinds technical innovations mentioned briefly previous subsection mean today , course , body fungible never . Limbs , organs genes bodily ‘ things ’ , via technical manipulation , potentially available purchase sale capitalist economic context . Though Harvey (      ) recently turned attention body , much eye biological moral issues.   – Spaces hope , example ( Harvey ,      : Chapters       ) – resorts rather abstract notion ‘ species ’ redolent early Marx . Dickens (      ) , contrast , puts corpore- ality front-and-centre grounded way , recalling Edward Yoxen ’ work     s bodily transgressions technoscience ( e.g. , Yoxen ,      ) . One Dickens ’ principal theses human biology becoming commodity like point , near future , whole persons commodified , parts thereof . Specifically , moral objections slowly overidden , sees gene splicing , germ-line therapy like creating new genetic classes ‘ haves ’ buy ‘ right ’ genes offspring . Though , case , ‘ barriers ’ primarily ethical physical , intimately connected material specificities human person . Indeed , overriding barriers involves acceptance ethical claims – like idea pricing person parts thereof moral good either benefits confers ( e.g. , possibility living life free ‘ genetic disease ’ ) .   Nature information fourth major category nature whose commodification contemporary Marxists attend nature information . may seem odd first sight : ‘ nature ’ information typically think physical tangible ? response nature de- re-materialized sorts ways , distinction ‘ real ’ nature ‘ artificial ’ relations simply blurred ‘ absolutely fragile ’ ( Parry ,      :     ) . ‘ internal natures ’ already mentioned , course , artificial ‘ second natures ’ , share ‘ external natures ’ tangible physicality . contrast , nature information – equally physical – materially different . based , , whole variety internal , external , matter , human natures one could conceive . good example informa- tional nature genetic database . database could exist without ‘ real ’ genes describes . However , unlike genes , information infinitely decomposable easy move . strand DNA , example , analysed multiple ways yield myriad bites information . turn , access information , indeed information , become commodity available sale purchase form computer disks , e-mail attachments ( Bowker ,      ) .

Though , nature categories easily decomposed reveal important material differences among ‘ natural ’ entities . synthesize insights identify principal modalities nature commodification work literature reviewed . interconnected modalities already mentioned passing , well consider together formally . Note four modalities identified , theoretically , transect one four categories nature discussed . summarize , first talk commodification effects . physical effects impact upon non-commodities commodification certain things proximate related non-commodities . example , one indigenous group commodifies folk knowledge , might prevent nearby indigenous group earning revenue selling similar kind knowledge . already seen , atmospheric pollution another important commodification effect , many one could consider . Second , incomplete commodification . refers cases nature puts barriers way complete commodi- fication . barriers either ‘ internal ’ ‘ external ’ commodification process , saw , found human non-human nature . case , barriers relative commodification process . materiality ‘ produced ’ relatively autonomous natures , turn , produce ecological , corporeal social effects lead problems selling commodities question . Third , already explained , real commodification involves physical privatization , alienation , individuation , etc. , entity actual market .

Finally , distinguish proxy commodification , precursor real commodification coexist . explained , involves treating uncommodified entities commodities way manufactured markets via cost-benefit analysis techniques . Though schematic , typology suggests two important things . First , indicates commodification works rather differently depending specific nature question . Even Marxist authors mentioned specify six facets commodification respective accounts – – com- modification would indifferent natures commodified . Thus , Noel Castree     seen , natures ‘ resist ’ complete commodification ( physically morally ) , others readily subsumed . flip-side , second point note , different natures different types degree ‘ agency ’ . agency work either commodification process thus real material importance . Thus , many seeds made compliant via hybridization genetic modification , commodification-effects automobiles , contrast , ‘ runaway ’ , manufactured threats like atmospheric pollution . means real analytical discrimination must used examining capitalist commodifi- cation natures . form material outcome process depends articu- lation specific natures combination six dimensions commodifica- tion identified earlier . IV Normative questions : explanation critique penultimate part essay turn explanatory normative issues.   two , course , intimately linked . unorthodox , reconstructed Marxists separate ‘ facts ’ ‘ values ’ suppose analysis evaluation-free . say ‘ ought ’ derived ‘ ’ ‘ strong ’ highly specific sense – though , like Bhaskar (      ) appear believe , fact , done . Yet suggest notion problems solutions , however ill defined , implicit forms Marxian analysis . present context , Peter Jackson (      :    ) complained ‘ rhetoric moral outrage blanket disapproval ’ , view , traditionally accompanied Marxian commodity analyses . Meanwhile , author sympathetic historical materialism variants – Andrew Sayer (      : Part IV ) – characteristically honest normative shortcomings . , revolve around studied refusal explore rigorously normative standpoints criticisms launched also feasibility alternate realities implied criticisms . confirm argument , Peffer ’ (      ) important work virtually unique contemporary exercise systematic normative argumentation Marxist . present context , therefore ask : Marxists right largely negative commodification aspects nature ( , indeed , largely negative ) ? ; whether negative ambivalent , reasons offered justify particular readings nature commodification capitalist societies ? ; reasons defensible ? ; implied alternatives commodification practicable ? asking questions , recalling Marxism ’ founding aspirations critique political economy rather economics.   Providing clear answers vital number reasons . First , Marxian explanations secrete criticisms , need know , precisely , wrong capitalist commodification specific natures . critique left implicit becomes much harder offer reasoned arguments ills commodification . Second , Marxist criticisms ultimately count little alternatives imply suggest infeasible . Though something said utopian-anticipatory thought experiments ( see , example , Harvey ,      : Part III ) , power attenuated absence practical propositions change . section want lay bare , part implicit , normative arguments made Marxists relation     Commodifying nature ? capitalist commodification nature/s . distinctions made previous sections different categories nature commodification become especially important . Marxian evaluations vary – , , perhaps vary – depending kind nature commodified . Intentionally , introduces degree complexity logics Marxian criticism . well grasp normative variance rather expect one exclusive Marxian mode evaluation operative . Nature , course , focus original explicit normative thinking recent times . Deep ecologists , animal liberationists bioethi- cists many prepared offer systematic arguments treatment non-humans new technical incursions human biology . ironic , , Marxism – tradition thinking characteristically critical studies – muted evaluations environments , bodies ecologies impacted capitalism.   Ted Benton (      ) David Harvey (      ) almost alone explicitly linking diagnosis critique writings nature – subject Peffer (      ) consider . Benton grounds discussion animal rights theory human needs , adapted Doyal Gough (      ) . Harvey , adapting Iris Young ’ (      ) work , argues kind justice predicated liveable local global environments . Even , authors attend normative standpoints practical alternatives . Benton Harvey aside , value judgements normative recommendations secreted Marxian explanations nature commodification remain , part , implicit poorly articulated.   Yet judgements recommendations undoubtedly animate – oddly muted way – work Marxian authors discussed . results surprising imbalance analysis critique.   illustrative rather exhaustive way , highlight range normative arguments play ask questions defensibility arguments . Ultimately , comprehensive analysis necessary – one looks aspect commodification relation different natures , weighing problems case . follows thus nothing suggestive precursor analysis .   Normative standpoints Critique would , course , impossible without normative standpoints . standpoints ‘ benchmark ’ object analysis evaluated . vary according theoretical political perspective analyst , necessarily make reducible analyst ’ personal predilections . Normative standpoints historically geographically specific transhistorical geo- graphically universal . internal objects analysis else introduced externally . simple vague else complex detailed . cognitive , ethical and/or aesthetic referents . Finally , apply certain things others ( humans non-humans ) , instead , ecumenical scope . Logically , requirement given critic work one normative standpoint ; critic held several standpoints simul- taneously , fact , contradictory , would one cause logical practical concern . Noel Castree     Already clear considering normative standpoints gets us potentially complicated territory ; territory Marxist analysts nature ’ commodifi- cation exploring explicit way . yet happened main relatively easy illustrate . organize comments three related subsections : first types normative standpoint ; second justifications standpoints ; third reflection first two . Modes critique : Sayer (      :     ) argues critical theorists typically operate one two types normative criticism . first cognitive-explanatory critique , belief shown false considered ipso facto ‘ wrong ’ . second needs-based critique grounded identification human and/or non- human suffering harm . However , least two modes critique identified ( Benhabib ,      ; McCarney ,      ) . One immanent critique , object analysis shown fall short normative standards . dialectical critique object analysis shown internally contradictory thus , sense , ‘ auto-critical ’ . four broad types normative argumentation mutually exclusive readily collapsed one . raise important questions logic critique . instance , immanent critique might expose failings something according standards ( never mind different exacting ones ) , standards aspired else superseded ? Somewhat differently , ‘ needs ’ defined need-based critique whose needs considered ? putative ‘ global humanity ’ particular community ? similar questions difficult answer yet implicit four modes critique distinguished . modes feature different Marxists ’ work nature commodification . However , exception Benton Harvey , rarely named explicitly defended . two dimensions : one lack justification one mode critique another ; , lack explicit justification mode right . instance , Hartwick ’ much cognitive-explanatory critique . logic critique clear enough : show consumers socionatural violence attendant upon gold production something like Damascene awakening might occur . However , exposure falsity , , necessarily imply something ‘ bad ’ . Consumers might carry consuming willy-nilly , even shown commodities really ‘ embody ’ . , Hartwick ’ cognitive-explanatory critique preferred dialectical critique gold mining ( critique offer ) ? Similarly , explanatory logic Bridge ’ account commodifying copper clear critical dimensions overtly justified . shows material contradictions result treating copper readily extracted geological biospheric integument , exacting reader work might ask : wrong contradictions ? , example , creation waste streams copper production negatively evaluated ? forms production increase entropy ? answers questions self-evident . instance , may case socioecological contradictions , pace ’ Connor , help generate crises capitalism thus move us post- capitalist future . Equally , though , may case robustness capitalism means must somehow learn live contradictions ameliorate worst effects . two answers imply rather different judgements     Commodifying nature ? ‘ goodness ’ ‘ badness ’ contradictions arising commodification ‘ external nature ’ . b Normative justifications : much modes critique . Within modes several conceivable normative standpoints could , theoretically , inform act critique . example , depending object analysis , immanent critique could predicated number grounds ; likewise , needs- based critique could underpinned universal contingent principles . point , , specific justifications critique – whatever mode critique deployed – need rendered transparent . , rarely case Marxian work nature ’ commodificaton . Let us take three several authors whose work already mentioned essay ( Benton Harvey excepted ) . Dickens (      ) , account commodification human body , implies formation ‘ genetic classes ’ underclasses wrong . Though may instinctively agree , explain . people enjoy equal life chances born ? human body commodified people objects bought sold ? questions imply different normative standpoints , remain largely unanswered unjustified Dickens ’ account . Robertson (      ) , wetlands research , equally inexplicit normative sense . Clearly , regards economic trading-off qualitatively unique wetlands USA sense problematic . , offers reasons concern . instance , argues individual wetlands , reality , commensurated site-specific nature . Beyond , however , clear commodification ‘ bad ’ . local communities losing local wetlands ? trading wetlands offends plant , animal microbial species constitute ? Robertson ’ standpoint anthropocentric , ecocentric synthesis two ? Finally , Kloppenburg (      ) , account seed commodification , offers least two reasons objectionable process . First , disenfranchized farmers ‘ stolen ’ previously free good public domain ; second , associated rise monocultures widespread use pesticides herbicides . reasons clear enough , particular normative standpoints imply remain somewhat buried unjustified . example , assumed self-evident monocultures undesirable . Yet linked high yields , implied opposite – world mixed , non-chemical agriculture – might readily feed current population numbers . Likewise , though farmers must pay hybrid genetically modified seeds , seeds also produce higher yields farmers . pros cons weighed ? , let clear , acting c Complexity , abstraction ambivalence : apologist worst aspects capitalist commodification nature . also , one sense , unfair calling authors account something set : , undertake systematic normative argu- mentation . Even , hopefully clear assuming , even asserting , normative standpoints – level modes critique specific normative justifications within modes – simply leaves many important questions unanswered . present context , synthesize insights previous two Noel Castree     subsections draw three conclusions implied normative standpoints Marxian authors considered adopt . First , standpoints highly diverse . Indeed , may incommensurable . necessarily problem – , , God-given requirement singular Marxian reading com- modification ’ ills – introduce real complexity assessment nature ’ commodification within capitalism . Second , implied normative standpoints frequently vague else highly open-ended . , necessarily problem . instance , though abstract , implied contrast space found Altvater ’ (      ) work clear enough aspired openly debated : , world Amazonian hardwoods , say , ripped ecological context willy-nilly . However , standpoints abstract , risk becoming vacuous . avoid , often necessary properly spell justify standpoints question . remains done much work reviewed . Finally , , even within , work authors considered , normative standpoints might contradictory ambivalent . raises difficult issue reconcile , else work , contradictions ambivalences . example , though Harvey (      ) highly critical nature ’ commodification capitalism , like Marx acknowledges unremittingly bad thing . , contributed high standard living many people worldwide currently enjoy . , , normative arguments two-sided without becoming incoherent ?   Future alternatives Normative standpoints always imply alternatives criticized – however hazy notional implied alternatives might . Sayer (      ) argues , important render alternatives explicit nature feasibility scrutinized . Critique count little future alternatives largely wholly impractical . want dwell question future alternatives , mostly virtually none Marxists writing nature commodification make stab exploring . symptomatic wider reluctance among Marxist intel- lectuals offer ‘ blueprints ’ change . Yet ‘ blueprints ’ need unduly program- matic detailed . least , Marxist critics nature ’ commodification need attend two distinctions – one quite venerable – help think practical alternatives . first relates type changes one might make current commodification practices . Benhabib (      ) makes useful distinction ‘ politics fulfillment ’ ‘ politics transfiguration ’ , roughly translate reformism versus revolution . former entails ‘ best ’ current situation working full potential ; latter , obviously , implies qualitative change far harder achieve . present context , example would choice , viz . Dickens ’ argument , placing ethical limits com- modifying human bodies within capitalism abolishing commodification altogether postcapitalist scenario . second useful distinction relates feasibility change – whether reformist otherwise – made Sayer (      :     ) . separates question whether enough people institutions could mobilized achieve desired goal feasibility goal ( e.g. , could one relate     Commodifying nature ? natures without use money economic system ? ) . two related synonymous require careful consideration right . course , even sensitized useful distinctions , Marxist attempt think practically alternatives nature commodification hazardous . Billig et al . (      ) rightly point , socionatural life ‘ dilemmatic ’ . , changing one thing ‘ good ’ complex , unintended counter-intuitive material ethical consequences . Fraser (      : Chapter   ) shows different context , befuddling consequences thought systematically pipe-dreams disentangled plausible propositions change . V Conclusions essay sought cut confusion arise trying understand Marxists critically theorize commodification nature capitalist societies . suggested polyvalence terms ‘ commodifica- tion ’ ‘ nature ’ obscure real differences Marxian interpretations reciprocal relations phenomena terms refer . Furthermore , argued Marxian criticisms commodification nature rather implicit vary substantively depending natures con- sideration . , , upshot attempt elucidate specific modalities commodification-nature-criticism nexus literature surveyed ? first place , indicates , contra critics , Marxists work conceptions commodification effects . Second , review suggested claims capitalist commodification nature – singular – viable high level theoretical abstraction . important pay close explanatory normative attention material properties different natures . Otherwise risk missing variety ways commodification plays , depending nature question . Finally , essay shown Marxists much better analysing commodification natures justifying critiques . , perhaps , time fill normative gap specificity capitalist commodification resisted robust critical grounds . upshot , hope , pave way rigorous understanding capitalist commodification , effects nature problems thereof . Capitalism remains major threat ecologies bodies kinds , micro macro scale . one unable explain exactly , however , left capitalism ’ apologists commodify everything point placing limits process – even replacing – seem utopian dream .
