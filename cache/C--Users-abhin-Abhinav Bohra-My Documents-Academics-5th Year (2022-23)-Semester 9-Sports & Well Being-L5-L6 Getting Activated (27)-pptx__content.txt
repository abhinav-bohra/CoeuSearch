Getting activated Mental preparedness and Psychological awareness  The concept of performance‚Äî a goal- directed behavior‚Äî plays a central role in contemporary culture. Everyone wants to perform better‚Äî not only in their careers, but also in their hobbies, relationships, and in pretty much everything else they do. And to perform better in any situation, it is necessary to focus on and develop the psychological skills that help lead to success https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJIJwGFRoLg To act or not to act ‚Äì The Action BiasMental preparedness and Psychological awareness  Just like physical skills, psychological ones can be taught, learned, and practiced. In understanding human behavior, both in individuals and in groups, you can develop these psychological skills and use them to heighten your awareness, foster your talents and abilities, and reach your peak performance Arousal Is a Lot of Stress Really That Bad? Arousal‚Äîa psychophysiological state of being awake or reactive to stimuli (i.e., general alertness and readiness to respond)‚Äî is the underpinning of stress, anxiety, pressure, and even motivationThe concept dates back thousands upon thousands of years to our distant prehistoric ancestors In business, as in sports, one may not be handling life and death situations such as soldiers in battle or a prehistoric person facing off against a tiger, but arousal, or high levels of stress, can be used to your benefit in both everyday and extraordinary circumstancesUnderstanding how to healthily and positively handle and harness stress makes one more productivelead a happier and more inspired life The concept of stress STRESS AND PERFORMANCEStress is not necessarily something bad, it all depends on how you take it - Hans Selye A classic experiment conducted in 1908 by Robert M. Yerkes (1876‚Äì 1956), a pioneer of American psychology, and his colleague John D. Dodson, is highly relevant to the question of how stress influences performanceThey investigated ‚Äúthe relation of strength of stimulus to rapidity of habit- formation,‚Äù (Journal of Comparative Neurology and Psychology)They discovered that mild electrical shocks could effectively be used to cause mice to acquire the habit of completing a maze. If the electrical shocks were too mild or too strong, however, the mice‚Äôs performance in the maze decreased. From this they developed what is now called the Yerkes- Dodson law which shows a curvilinear relationship between stress and performance Yerkes Dodson Law- Stress arousal and Performance  Types of Stress  ACUTE  STRESS	 CHRONIC STRESS  Episodic Acute Stress Episodic acute stress and its Symptoms Symptoms of extended over arousal	Persistent tension headaches	Migraines	Hypertension	Chest pain Digestion problemsResistant to change When acute stress happens frequently, it‚Äôs called episodic acute stressDisplays prolonged effects of acute stressNegative health effectsPersonality is an important factor for developing acute stress Chronic Stress WarfareFinancial crisisTraumatic experiencesChronic illnessesDysfunctional familiesCreates LEARNED HELPLESSNESSDealing with chronic stress increases psychosomatic problems Grinding stress that wears people away day after day year after year  Common signs of stress Stress affects appetite and digestionStress affects cognition Physical signsDry mouthDifficulty breathingPounding heartStomach-acheChronic headache Effect of stress on performance  Psychological signssudden irritabilityproblems concentratingDifficulty sleepingNarrowed perceptionFrequent feelings of fatigue Stress and its physiology The brain reacts to stress in a series of neural and chemical reactions that are meant for physical survival Stress caused by 	biological agents ‚Äì viruses	environment ‚Äì temperature	psychological agents ‚Äì threat to self esteem, loss of loved 	one resulting in loneliness, social isolation etc Physiological Systems Involved in the Stress Response The nervous system The endocrine systemThe immune systemOptimally, interaction of these systems maintains homeostasis and wellness Triggering the HPA axis The Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal Axis or HPA axis ‚Äì best known for its role in body‚Äôs natural reaction to stressHPA axis includes a group of hormone secreting glands from theNERVOUS and ENDOCRINE SYSTEMThis network consists of the Hypothalamus, the Pituitary gland and the Adrenal glands When one experiences a stressful event:The hypothalamus releases a hormone called the Corticotrophin Hormone (CRH)CRH signals the Pituitary Gland to secrete the Adreno Cortico Tropic Hormone (ACTH) into the blood streamACTH travels down to the Adrenal glands where it prompts the release of Glucocorticoids from the Adrenal CortexOne of these Glucocorticoids is Cortisol which plays an important role in stress responseWith increased cortisol level ü°™ Epinephrine and Norepinephrine (hormones) secreted from Adrenal Medulla HPA axis‚Ä¶ As epinephrine circulates through the body, it brings on number of physiological changes:The heart beats faster than normal pushing blood to the muscles, heart, and other vital organsPulse rate and blood pressure go up The person undergoing these changes also starts to breathe more rapidly  Small airways in the lungs open wide - the lungs can take in as much oxygen as possible with each breath. Extra oxygen is sent to the brain, increasing alertnessThus, Sight, hearing, and other senses become sharperThe release of cortisol causes number of changes that helps the body deal with stressEg: Helps body mobilise energy like glucose so that body has enough energy to cope with prolonged stressWhen the threat passes, cortisol levels fallThe parasympathetic nervous system ‚Äî the "brake" ‚Äî then dampens the stress response WHY DO INDIVIDUALS BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY DURING STRESS? Individual differencescognitive reaction to a situation - appraisal of the nature, importance and implications of the event, and by your ability to effectively manage or cope with the eventemotional responses to a situation - determined by appraisal of situation and coping abilities Ex: ‚ÄúI can handle this,‚Äù ‚Äì planning ways to handle the situation‚ÄúThis is terrible. I‚Äôm going crazy‚Äù - quitting, getting more anxious  Stress depends on how an individual perceives a situation Perception of the ability to cope with the situationThe individual's judgment that a stressful situation exists, initiates a stress response Without this appraisal there is no stress in the person's psychological schema  Importance of knowing physiology of stress:If one understands the physiology of stress, then one can begin to use this knowledge to augment one‚Äôs own health and well-being through different stress management techniquesIt is important to know what happens to our body during a stressful situation‚Ä¶ Factors of Personality related to stress Main Characteristics of Type A Behavior A sense of time urgency and hostility - A feeling that there is not enough time to do all the things that we believe should be done or that we wish to do. symptoms:Rapid movements: The afflicted person usually walks, talks or eats fast Impatience: There is a feeling that the rate at which most events take place is too slow Anguish at waiting in line or waiting to be seated in a restaurant. Avoids repetitive tasksTension: finds it difficult to sit and do nothing. Feels guilty when relaxing He often has a characteristic facial tautness expressing tension and anxietyRestlessness: knee jiggling, rapid tapping of the fingers, head nodding, rapid eyebrow lifting while speaking, sucking in air while speaking, tongue-to-front-teeth clicking during conversation, or tuneless hummingPreoccupation: Inattentive to others. Unable to detect mental and physical fatigue while engaged in a task. Fails to observe seemingly unimportant unrelated things 2. Hostility ‚Äì 	a predisposition to evaluate people or events negatively, 		often in a suspicious, distrustful, cynical, and paranoid 		fashionThere is a generalized aggression or excessive competitive drive Type BPeople with Type B personality tend to be more tolerant of others, are more relaxed than Type A individuals, more reflective, experience lower levels of anxiety and display higher level of imagination and creativity Type A Personality ‚Äì Jenkins Activity SurveyOnline version for college students - www.psych.uncc.edu/pagoolka/TypeA-B-intro.html Other Personality Types  Developing resilience to stress HARDINESS Hardiness moderates the stress‚Äìillness relationship by reducing cognitive appraisals of threat, and reducing the use of regressive coping  Are you serious about stress?  There is an old joke about a man who went to a psychiatrist because of a problem with thumb-sucking. After several months of therapy, the patient was delighted with the results and was describing them to a friend. "So," the friend said, "you don't suck your thumb any more?" "Oh, no," replied the patient, "I still suck it as much as ever. But now I know why!‚Äú Learning about stress can produce similar problemsYou can understand the stress reaction, and even note the signs of stress in your everyday life, yet still have little idea of what to do about it Simply knowing about stress is not enough Achieving real control over stress requires something more: an understanding of the unique patterns that stress takes in your lifeThis personal understanding is necessary because the actual patterns that trigger stress reactions vary enormously from one person to the next Understanding your stress level  Stress mapping‚Ä¶ Work on your stress level Discover patterns of stress operating in your lifeBe aware of these signs of physical and mental response to stressIdentify the triggersAnalyze the relationship between the stress reaction and the stressful situation that evoked it Set realistic and effective stress control Format for a stress JournalDate and Time:Signal of stress:Duration of symptom:Events prior to the symptom:Events when symptoms stopped: Shaffer, M, 1982 Bodily symptoms FlushingSweatingDry mouthShallow breathingChest oppression and painHeart palpitationPounding pulselncreased blood pressureHeadache-BackacheFeeling of weaknessIntestinal distressVomitingDiarrhea ConstipationFatigueLoss of appetiteNervous chillInsomniarestlessnessFlatus (passing gas)BelchingAbdominal cramping"Irritable colon"Dizziness or faintnessParesthesias (illusory prickly skinsensations) AgitationShakinessEasy tiringWorryPanicky feelingDepression (feeling blue)Irritability Feeling States Cognitive States DreadInattentionDistractibilityForgetfulnessNightmaresFear of death Motor Symptoms (muscles involved) Muscular tightnessTremorsTics (spasms)Increased startle reactionIncoordinationSighingFreezing, feeling immobilized How many of these symptoms do you have now/ in recent past?  As an IndividualAim for an optimal state of stress and arousal to keep you on your toes, staying involved and productive, without overworking yourself or entering a state of chronic stressRemember that obstacles and tasks are subjective‚Äî your personal perception can be a major determinant in how you handle stress and how it affects your performanceMake complex tasks simpler by employing chunking techniques, breaking down your actions into smaller, discrete units As a LeaderFind the sweet spot when it comes to your personal levels of stress and that of the group, you‚Äôre leadingThe environment that leaders create and cultivate is crucial to employee performance‚Äî talk to your team about what works best for them and see how you can incorporate their preferences into the surrounding environmentRecognize that there will be Type A and Type B people on your team, and you will have to motivate them accordingly‚Äî the Type A group will likely need help decreasing stress and anxiety while Type B will need some added pressure Daily Practices
