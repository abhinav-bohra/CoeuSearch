EVALUATION REPORT  APRIL 2018  Evaluation Report of the Human  Rights Strategy Submitted by  2026 FIFA World Cup Bidders  United Bid (Canada, Mexico, United States)                    BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  1  About this Report  This report was written by three members of BSR’s human rights team—Aude Ucla, Jean-Baptiste  Andrieu, and Salah Husseini—with additional guidance and insights provided by Margaret Jungk and  John Hodges. Any errors that remain are those of the authors.  The purpose of the report is to provide an external assessment of the Human Rights Strategy submitted  as part of the United bid for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. It is intended to inform the Fédération  Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) about the United bid team’s understanding of the human  rights risks related to the hosting and staging of the 2026 World Cup in Canada, Mexico, and the United  States, including legacy and post-event activities, and the robustness of the proposed Strategy to address  these risks and hold a competition in accordance with human rights expectations, particularly the United  Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).  This report has been developed at the request of FIFA and follows the evaluation structure that was  proposed by FIFA’s Sustainability & Diversity Department. It provides an independent analysis of three  key aspects of the Human Rights Strategy proposed in the United bid:  » Quality of the human rights risk-assessment: This section of the report reviews the United bid’s  identification and assessment of the risk of adverse human rights impacts in connection with the  hosting and staging of the competition, including legacy and post-event related activities, with which  the Member Associations of Canada, Mexico, and the United States may be involved through their  own activities or as a result of their business relationships.  » Meaningfulness of the stakeholder engagement: This section reviews how the United bid drew on  internal and external expertise and involved consultations with potentially affected groups and other  stakeholders as part of the development of its Human Rights Strategy.  » Quality of the proposed measures to address and remediate the risks identified: This section reviews  the measures that the United bid proposes in order to prevent and mitigate any risks of adverse  human rights impacts that have been identified, as well as how the Member Associations intend to  provide for or cooperate in appropriate and effective grievance mechanisms for individuals and  communities whose human rights may be impacted by Member Associations’ own activities or as a  result of their business relationships.  To perform this assessment, BSR reviewed the relevant documents submitted by the United team  including:  » Ergon Associates’ independent study assessing how the national context, including the national  legislation and legal practice, may impede or enable the Member Associations’ ability to host and  stage the Competition in a manner that respects all internationally-recognized human rights;  » United team’s bid book Chapter E of the Sustainable Event Management, chapter 23 on human  rights and labor standards; and  BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  2  » United team’s detailed Human Rights Strategy identifying and assessing any risk of adverse human  rights impacts in connection with the hosting and staging of the competition, including legacy and  post-event related activities.  In addition, BSR asked the United team in writing a series of clarification questions on the content of the  bid and received general input from two members of FIFA’s Human Rights Advisory Board.  DISCLAIMER  The authors wrote this evaluation report with total independence. The analyses reflect BSR’s specific  expertise in business and human rights matters and local context knowledge, and draws on the BSR  team’s experience devising Human Rights Strategies for companies and organizations operating in  various sectors, including the organization of mega sporting events.  BSR’s findings are based on the information included in the documents submitted by the United team.  The BSR team did not conduct field research or engage stakeholders outside of FIFA.  BSR will not be held liable for any direct or consequential loss arising from reliance on the information  contained herein.  For the avoidance of any doubt, BSR's mandate was limited to evaluating the strategy provided by the  bidder and did not extend to an analysis of the commitments and guarantees provided by the Moroccan  Government and host cities. The commitments and guarantees of the Government and host cities are of  relevance to the present evaluation only to the extent that they are seen to significantly influence the  robustness of the proposed strategy by the bidder.        BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  3  Contents  About this Report ........................................................................................ 1  Executive Summary .................................................................................... 4  Context and Methodology ........................................................................... 6  Assessing Human Rights Risks ................................................................ 12  Engaging Stakeholders on Human Rights ................................................ 19  Addressing Human Rights Risks ............................................................... 24  Conclusions .............................................................................................. 29      BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  4  Executive Summary  This report presents an independent evaluation of the Human Rights  Strategy submitted by the Member Association of Mexico, Canada, and the  United States in completion of FIFA’s new bidding process for the 2026  Football World Cup.  Context and Methodology  The most popular sport on the planet, football unites the world from kids in underserved communities to  elite football professionals playing in the world’s most spectacular sports arenas. Through its central value  of fair play, it promotes the principles of mutual respect and equal treatment that unite people around the  world. While a football match can be a communal and joyful experience for millions, if not billions, of  people, organizing major competitions like the World Cup is a complex operation that affects the lives of  many—from the construction workers building the required sports or transport infrastructures, to the  spectators, journalists, and football players participating in the Competition, to the football fans around the  globe watching the games on their televisions. To ensure the World Cup only leaves a positive mark on  the people, FIFA reviewed and enhanced the process of selecting the Football Associations that will have  the privilege of hosting the 2026 Football World Cup. For the first time, the associations were expected to  respect international human rights and labor standards and align with the United Nations’ Guiding  Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). This evaluation report is intended to inform FIFA  about the bid teams’ understanding of the human rights risks related to the hosting and staging of the  competition, including legacy and post-event activities, and the robustness of the proposed Strategy to  address these risks and hold a competition in accordance with human rights expectations.  Evaluation Findings  As per the new FIFA bid requirements, the 2026 United Bidding Nations, comprised of Canada, Mexico,  and the United States, proposes a Human Rights Strategy that summarizes the identification and  assessment of human rights impacts in connection with hosting and staging of the Competition based on  an independent study that detailed how the national legislation and legal practice in the host countries  could impede or enable the host countries to deliver the World Cup in a manner respectful of human  rights. The Strategy also provides information about how human rights impacts will be managed  effectively and details an action plan across 10 key findings from the independent report (e.g.,  discrimination, freedom of expression and assembly, land use, and housing rights).  The information included in these documents provide a thorough risk assessment of human rights risks  associated with hosting the World Cup in Canada, Mexico, and the United States and proposes robust  measures to conduct ongoing due diligence and remedy potential negative impacts, consistent with  expectations set by the UNGPs. The assessment and proposed remediation measures are informed by a  robust stakeholder engagement process that engaged over 60 stakeholders representing a range of  interests and areas of expertise.  BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  5  The Independent Context Analysis conducted by Ergon represents a thorough investigation into the  potential human rights impacts of the World Cup as well as the existing legal infrastructure in place at the  national, state, and municipal level in each of the host countries. The strategy proposed by the United bid  team takes into account the findings of the independent analysis and incorporates those findings into the  Strategy itself.   Overall Assessment   Quality of the risk assessment conducted by the Member Association: Very Good   Meaningfulness of stakeholder engagement: Very Good   Quality of the proposed measures to address and remediate risks: Very Good  ASSESSING HUMAN RIGHTS  The human rights risk assessment proposed by the United bid is very good. The report provides an  extensive and critical review of the legal frameworks applicable in each of the three countries included in  the bid. The report also includes a robust risk assessment that covers a comprehensive range of impacts  and reflects well the different phases of the Competition. Although not described in detail in the bid  documents, the United team also relies on a robust impact assessment methodology that follows the  recommendation of the UNGPs and includes a good level of stakeholder engagement. While the set of  rights considered is thorough, the United team does not provide much information or analysis on the  human rights-related impact of the Competition on water, which is a country risk flagged by a number of  reputable organizations for both Mexico and the United States.  ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS ON HUMAN RIGHTS  The level of engagement of stakeholders in the United bid is very good. The United team has  implemented a robust engagement of nearly 60 stakeholders from government, academia, and  international and local-level NGOs in each of three countries included in the bid. Throughout the report,  incorporation of stakeholder feedback in the analysis of potential risks and impacts is evident, and there is  a good level of consideration given to vulnerable groups. However, it is not clear how stakeholders were  prioritized so as to ensure a robust engagement with those most at risk of being negatively impacted or  being most vulnerable.  ADDRESSING HUMAN RIGHTS RISKS  The public commitment and proposed measures to address human rights risks and remedy potential  negative impacts are very good overall and well aligned with expectations set in the UNGPs. In particular,  the report commits to ongoing due diligence, remediating human rights impacts, providing effective  grievance mechanisms, and remaining transparent throughout these processes. The Strategy clearly  benefited from a robust level of engagement and input from stakeholders and identifies areas where  additional engagement with local stakeholders, such as municipal government, is necessary for the  purposes of the mitigation strategy.          BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  6  Context and Methodology  The most popular sport on the planet, football unites the world from kids in  underserved communities to elite football professionals playing in the  world’s most spectacular sports arenas. Through its central value of fair  play, football promotes the principles of mutual respect and equal treatment  that unite people across the globe. While a football match can be a  communal and joyful experience for millions, if not billions, of people,  organizing major competitions such as the World Cup is a complex  operation that affects the lives of many—from the construction workers  building the required sports or transport infrastructures, to the spectators,  journalists, and football players participating in the event, to the football  fans from around the world watching the games on their televisions. To  ensure the World Cup only leaves a positive mark on the people, FIFA  reviewed and enhanced the process of selecting the Football Associations  that will have the privilege of hosting the 2026 World Cup. For the first time,  the organizations are expected to respect international human rights and  labor standards and align with the United Nations’ Guiding Principles on  Business and Human Rights. This evaluation report is intended to inform  FIFA about the bid teams’ understanding of the human rights risks related  to the hosting and staging of the competition, including legacy and post- event activities, and the robustness of the proposed Strategy to address  these risks and hold a competition in accordance with human rights  expectations.  Business and Human Rights  The international human rights regime is our world’s “code of conduct on the ethical treatment of people.”  It spans all political, cultural, and ideological differences around the world and represents a global  consensus on the basic dignity, freedoms, and needs of every person on our planet. Human rights are  therefore not something granted to individuals; they are intrinsic to being human.  BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  7  Companies can impact human rights in many ways. As global operators, they can have wide-reaching  impacts across the world, both positive and negative, and until the adoption of the United Nations Guiding  Principles on Business and Human Rights in 2011, it was not always clear who was responsible for  preventing human rights abuses by companies. The adoption of the UNGPs provided a much-needed  clarification between states’ responsibility to protect human rights by passing laws that prevent violations  and making sure that laws are implemented, and companies’ responsibility to respect human rights by  refraining from violating human rights, even when laws and regulations are absent or not enforced.  At the time of their adoption, the UNGPs were described by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights  Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein as “the global authoritative standard, providing a blueprint for the steps all states  and businesses should take to uphold human rights.” Since then, the expectations of the UNGPs have  been incorporated into all existing standards and responsibility frameworks. Stakeholders and civil society  organizations in particular are now using them to hold companies accountable, and some countries have  started incorporating similar expectations into national regulatory frameworks that makes companies’  responsibility to respect human rights the guiding star for responsible business.  THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE UN GUIDING PRINCIPLES ON  BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS  The UNGPs consist of 31 principles designed to implement the UN “Protect, Respect and Remedy”  framework on the issue of human rights with respect to transnational corporations and other business  enterprises. Unanimously endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council, the UNGPs encompass three  pillars outlining how states and businesses should implement the framework:  » The state duty to protect human rights against human rights abuses through regulation,  policymaking, investigation, and enforcement.  » The corporate responsibility to respect human rights: that is, to avoid infringing on the human rights  of others through their activities or business relationships, and to address harms with which they are  involved.  » The need for victims of business-related human rights abuses to access effective remedy. Both  states and enterprises have a role to play in enabling this.  The UNGPs affirm the fundamental responsibility that companies must respect human rights of all those  that are potentially affected (workers, communities, consumers) by their operations and by their business  relationships, and provide a blueprint for companies to do so that specifies the policies and processes  companies need to have in place to ensure that they respect human rights, including:  » A policy commitment to meet their responsibility to respect human rights;  » An ongoing process of due diligence to assess the human rights context, identify who may be  affected, and project how the proposed activity and associated business relationships could have  adverse human rights impacts on those identified. In addition, the process integrates the findings  into decision-making and actions in order to prevent and mitigate the risks, tracks the effectiveness  of the measures, and communicates efforts.  BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  8  » Processes to enable the remediation of any adverse human rights impacts they cause or to which  they contribute.  The UNGPs further expand on the factors that companies should take into consideration when  developing due diligence measures and remediation mechanisms. The UN principles assert that  companies should pay particular attention to marginalized or vulnerable groups—migrants; disabled;  indigenous; ethnic minorities; women; children; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex  community (LGBTQ); etc.—and insist on the importance of involving meaningful consultation with  potentially affected groups and other relevant stakeholders. The UNGPs then propose some guidance for  companies when they operate in countries where the laws and regulations do not align with the  international human rights regime. In such contexts, companies are expected to respect the principles of  internationally-recognized human rights to the greatest extent possible in the circumstances, and to be  able to demonstrate their efforts in this regard.  THE INCREASING STAKEHOLDER AND REGULATORY PRESSURE  The UNGPs do not impose any legal obligations on companies. As such they are an instrument of soft  law. Although the UN principles are not an enforceable standard, the responsibility of companies to  respect human rights is not something they can decide to switch on and off. None of what they do through  their sustainability or philanthropic programs can relieve them out of their responsibility to respect all  human rights.  Since their adoption, the UNGPs have been reflected in other international standards including the UN  Global Compact, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for  Multinational Enterprises, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards, and ISO  26000 Social Responsibility Guidance. They have also been endorsed by business and industry  associations representing thousands of companies and millions of workers around the world. In addition,  civil society organizations use the UNGPs to hold companies accountable and push for transparency on  their practices, including in their supply chains. In recent years, civil society groups are increasingly  ranking companies on their human rights impacts, and investors are beginning to ask companies hard  questions beyond the policy field, reinforcing the status of the UNGPs as the authoritative global standard  for corporate respect for human rights.  In parallel, a mandatory legal framework for respecting human rights has been expanding through the  adoption of a series of human rights reporting and due diligence legislations. This includes domestic as  well as extended regulations abroad through extraterritorial legislations such as the U.K.’s Modern  Slavery Act, the EU’s nonfinancial reporting directive, and France’s corporate duty of vigilance law. These  efforts point to a certain future: the enforcement of the widespread expectations that businesses must  respect human rights.  FIFA’s Expectations on Human Rights  FIFA has been affected by allegations about human rights abuses in connection with its events and  relationships. Since the selection of Russia and Qatar to host the World Cups in 2018 and 2022, media  and civil society have increasingly criticized FIFA for its lack of adequate corporate governance and  internal control systems to identify and manage adequately the significant adverse impacts the  organization of World Cups can have on individuals and communities, in particular when the Competition  takes place in countries which legislations contradicts the international human rights regime. FIFA has  BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  9  taken important steps in response to these concerns including the incorporation of human rights  considerations into World Cup bid requirements, which this report is evaluating.  FIFA’S HUMAN RIGHTS CONSIDERATIONS AND BID REQUIREMENTS  In 2011, not long after the selection of Russia and Qatar to host World Cups in 2018 and 2022, FIFA  decided to review the adequacy of its bidding requirements for the 2026 Men’s Football World Cup. In  2015 FIFA sought technical support from the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on  the UNGPs in relation to bidding documents for the 2026 Men’s World Cup. Later this year, FIFA asked  John Ruggie, author of the UNGPs, to provide recommendations for further embedding them into FIFA’s  policies and practices. In 2016, FIFA adopted a new provision in the FIFA Statutes (art. 3) that states:  “FIFA is committed to respecting all internationally recognized human rights and shall strive to promote  the protection of these rights.” In early 2017, FIFA established a Human Rights Advisory Board composed  of eight international human rights experts that commented on the development of FIFA’s first human  rights policy in May 2017 and worked closely with the administration on the revised 2026 bidding  documents. Those documents require the implementation of human rights and labor standards by the  bidding Member Associations, the government, and other entities involved in the organization of the  tournament, such as those responsible for the construction and renovation of stadiums, training sites,  hotels, and airports.  In practice, Member Associations bidding to host the 2026 World Cup were asked to provide a bid book  Chapter E report on Sustainable Event Management as well as a detailed Human Rights Strategy for the  competition. The Strategy was required to include the following elements:  » A comprehensive report identifying and assessing risks of adverse human rights impacts in  connection with the hosting and staging of the Competition. This report needs to be complemented  and informed by a study on how the national legislation and legal practice in the host  country/countries may impede or enable the bidder’s ability to host and stage the Competition in  accordance with internationally recognized human rights. This study needs to be developed by an  independent and competent institution approved by FIFA.  » Detailed information on how the bidders will (a) embed respect for human rights in their operational  policies and procedures as well as in their relationships with third parties, (b) implement an ongoing  due diligence process to identify, prevent, mitigate, and account for how they address adverse  impacts on human rights, and (c) ensure access to effective remediation where adverse human  rights impacts occur in relation to the tournament.  The bidding member association were also required to submit to FIFA a summary report outlining the  stakeholder engagement process implemented as part of the strategy development. In addition to these  requirements relating to the responsibilities of the bidding member association, FIFA also required the  bidders to submit human rights-related commitments and guarantees from governments, as well as  signed contracts with stadium, training sites, hotel and airport authorities that include detailed human  rights clauses. The evaluation of these additional documents is not subject to the present evaluation.  FIFA’S REQUEST FOR AN INDEPENDANT EVALUATION OF THE BID  On the basis of the enhanced bidding requirements FIFA recruited BSR to conduct an external evaluation  of the human rights strategies submitted by the bidders for the 2026 World Cup and to develop  propositions for a set of measures to be included in the so-called Corrective Action Protocol. The  BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  10  Corrective Action Protocol is a set of measures designed to further enhance the successful bidder's  human rights strategy. It is defined by FIFA and its implementation is mandatory under the terms of the  Hosting Agreement.  This report has been developed at the request of FIFA and follows the evaluation structure that was  proposed by FIFA’s Sustainability & Diversity Department. It provides an independent analysis of three  key aspects of the Human Rights Strategy proposed in the United Bid:  » Quality of the human rights risk-assessment: This section of the report reviews the United Bid’s  identification and assessment of the risk of adverse human rights impacts in connection with the  hosting and staging of the competition, including legacy and post-event related activities, with which  the Member Associations of Canada, Mexico, and the United States may be involved through their  own activities or as a result of their business relationships.  » Meaningfulness of the stakeholder engagement: This section of the report reviews how the United  Bid drew on internal and external expertise and involved consultations with potentially affected  groups and other stakeholders as part of the development of its Human Rights Strategy.  » Quality of the proposed measures to address and remediate the risks identified: This section of the  report reviews the measures that the United Bid proposes to prevent and mitigate any risks of  adverse human rights impacts that have been identified, as well as how the Member Associations  intend to provide for or cooperate in appropriate and effective grievance mechanisms for individuals  and communities whose human rights may be impacted by Member Associations’ own activities or  as a result of their business relationships.  To perform this assessment, BSR reviewed the relevant documents submitted by the United team,  including:  » Ergon Associates’ independent study assessing how the national context, including the national  legislation and legal practice, may impede or enable the Member Associations’ ability to host and  stage the competition in a manner that respects all internationally-recognized human rights;  » United team’s bid book Chapter E of the Sustainable Event Management, Chapter 23 on human  rights and labor standards; and  » United team’s detailed Human Rights Strategy identifying and assessing any risk of adverse human  rights impacts in connection with the hosting and staging of the competition, including legacy and  post-event related activities.  In addition, BSR asked the United team in writing a series of clarification questions on the content of the  bid and received general input from two members of FIFA’s Human Rights Advisory Board.  BSR’S EVALUATION METHODOLOGY  On the basis of FIFA’s proposed evaluation criteria and given the limited time frame available to complete  the evaluations, BSR developed a simple evaluation framework and methodology that enabled BSR’s  team to review the bids of the United team and the Morocco team in a way that was comparable, relying  on exactly the same level of information.  BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  11  FIFA Proposed Criteria for the Evaluation  Quality of the risk assessment  » Quality of the Independent Context Analysis  » Quality of the risk assessment conducted by the Member Association  Meaningfulness of stakeholder engagement  Quality of the proposed measures to address and remediate risks  For each main criterion proposed by FIFA, the framework developed by BSR relied on four to seven  indicators that defined a series of expectations. Information included in the bid documents were then  reviewed and organized within this framework and rated according to a four-tier scale: Insufficient, Basic,  Good, Very Good. The information included in the bid was then assessed by a member of BSR’s team  against each indicator and a justification to support the ranking was provided. The ranking and  justification were then reviewed by another member of BSR’s team. Once both analyses were completed,  all members of BSR’s team reviewed collectively the rankings and justification given in order to align and  calibrate the final findings. On this basis, BSR proposed an overall ranking for each of the main criteria  based on the same scale and developed a detailed narrative explanation to support it.        BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  12  Assessing Human Rights Risks  The human rights risk assessment proposed by the United bid is very good.  The report provides an extensive and critical review of the legal frameworks  applicable in each of the three countries included in the bid. The report also  includes a robust risk assessment that covers a comprehensive range of  impacts and reflects well the different phases of the competition. The  United team also relies on a robust impact assessment methodology that  follows the recommendations of the UNGPs and includes a good level of  stakeholder engagement, although not described in detail in the bid  documents. While the set of rights considered is thorough, the United team  does not provide much information or analysis on the human rights-related  impact of the competition on water, which is a country risk flagged by a  number of reputable organizations for both Mexico and the United States.  Quality of the Independent Context Analysis  LEGAL FRAMEWORKS REVIEWED AND SOURCES OF INFORMATION  The UNGPs stipulate that states must protect against human rights abuse within their territory and/or  jurisdiction and that this requires taking appropriate steps to prevent, investigate, punish, and redress  such abuse through effective policies, legislation, regulations, and adjudication. Companies do not  operate in a vacuum, and it is important that they understand the national legal frameworks in which they  operate because they provide the principal legal protection of human rights and may impede or enable  the Member Association’s ability to host and stage a competition in a manner that respects internationally  recognized human rights.  The review of the legal frameworks in Canada, Mexico, and the United States conducted by both the  United bid committee and as part of the Independent Context Analysis is comprehensive and relevant to  the issues commonly identified as salient to the organization of a mega sporting event. The Independent  Context Analysis takes into consideration 13 issues structured around five key rights-holder groups  (workers, communities, fans and spectators, players and officials, and journalist and human rights  defenders) and four cross-cutting issues.  » Workers and volunteers: right to adequate wage, including minimum wage requirements across  municipalities involved; freedom of association and collective bargaining, including the right to strike;  nondiscrimination in employment, including a review of anti-discrimination legislation at the national,  BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  13  state, and local level; occupational safety and health, including inspection and enforcement  mechanisms; and working hours, including overtime limits at federal, state, and local levels.  » Communities and citizens: land and property rights, including indigenous people’s land rights;  housing rights, such as the right to adequate housing as a human right; participation in the conduct  of public affairs, such as the right to information and legal frameworks criminalizing corruption that  prevents such participation; and freedom of expression and assembly, including a review of  limitations related to hate speech and public order.  » Players, fans, and spectators: international travel and movement; discrimination at and around  events and games including in associated services and facilities; privacy and personal data;  disability access to buildings, spaces, and facilities related to the games.  » Cross-cutting issues: safety and security and the use of security services; protections for journalists  and human rights defenders; trafficking across all aspects of the games; and grievances and  remedy, specifically related to the provision of justice and enforcement of the rule of law.  For each of the areas identified above, expectations outlined in international frameworks are compared  with existing legal frameworks in each of the three countries. In addition to providing a comprehensive  review of the legal frameworks in each of the host countries, the report also flags areas where the host  countries’ legal frameworks lack sufficient provisions to fully protect the rights identified as salient. For  instance, on the right to adequate housing, the Independent Context Analysis finds that Mexico’s legal  framework offers strong protections for the right to adequate housing, in accordance with international  standards, while Canada and the United States both lack an official recognition of the right to adequate  housing in their respective legal frameworks, which is a gap in relation to international standards.  Sample National Legal Frameworks Analyzed    American Disabilities Act (U.S.)  Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Canada)   General Law for the Inclusion of People with Disabilities (Mexico)      Fair Labor Standards Act (U.S.)  Protection of Personal Data in Possession of Private Individuals (Mexico)  Federal Law for the Prevention and Elimination of Discrimination (Mexico)  Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (Canada)  To conduct this analysis, the report references include 17 United Nations conventions, 13 International  Labor Organization conventions and recommendations, and six regional conventions and declarations. In  addition, the report also references a range of national and local legislations covering the following  general topics and focus areas: human rights and anti-trafficking; criminal affairs; police; labor, including  discrimination and health and safety regulation; anti-discrimination; land and indigenous rights;  Immigration and nationality; information, privacy rights, and transparency; disability rights.    BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  14  The Independent Context Analysis also includes thorough references to hundreds of reports, papers, and  articles from reputable international and local organizations, including civil society and trade union  organizations.  Sample of Sources of Information Referenced   Academic and Think Tanks: Harvard Law Review, Economic Policy Institute, Center for  Equitable Growth, National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty, Florida International  University, Giffords Law Center, etc.   Civil Society Organizations: Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Fair Labor  Association, Maquila Solidarity Network, Rights and Resources, Transparency International,  Freedom House, Thomson Reuters Foundation, etc.   International Organizations: United Nation, United Nations Human Rights Office of the High  Commissioner, International Labour Organization, etc.   Media: Animal Politico, BBC News, CBC News, Los Angeles Times, New York Times,  Washington Post, The Guardian, Expansion, Ipsnews, Globe and Mail, National Observer, etc.   National Institutions: U.S. Department of Labor, U.S. Department of State, Mexico Consejo  Nacional para Prevenir la Discriminacion, Employment and Social Development Canada, Equal  Opportunity Commission, Comisión de Derechos Humanos del Distrito Federal, U.S.  Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Comisión Mexicana de Defensa y Promoción de  los Derechos Humanos, National League of Cities, etc.   Unions: IndustriALL, International Trade Union Confederation, etc.  Together, these sources of information and legal frameworks reviewed provide a comprehensive picture  of the risk context in Canada, Mexico, and the United States.  EFFECTIVENESS OF THE NATIONAL AND LOCAL ENFORCEMENT  AND REMEDIATION MECHANISMS  The UNGPs emphasize states’ responsibility to enforce laws that are aimed at, or have the effect of,  requiring business enterprises to respect human rights. Merely listing a set of rules is not enough to  ensure their application; consequently, the implementation of human rights standards is closely watched  at several levels. Law enforcement is the responsibility of different agencies at either the national or the  regional level, such as the police, the courts, or government agencies (such as labor inspection).  Effectiveness of these agencies can be negatively impacted by corruption, lack of sufficient resources  (insufficient number of labor inspectors for instance), or lack of judicial independence and subsequently  impede or enable the Member Association’s ability to host and stage a competition in a manner that  respects internationally-recognized human rights.  The Independent Context Analysis provides comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of enforcement  mechanisms associated with the legal frameworks reviewed in Canada, Mexico, and the United States.  For each of the risk areas identified, the report provides a review of the key findings on the legal  frameworks in question, including the effectiveness of enforcement mechanisms. With respect to  enforcement of freedom of association and collective bargaining provisions in the United States for  instance, the report highlights that protections under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) are limited  to “employee status,” which is narrower than the term “worker” used in the relevant international      BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  15  conventions. Likewise, the report highlights that there are significant challenges in the enforcement of the  law on discrimination in employment in Mexico as penalties for violations of the law are not generally  considered sufficient to deter violations.  Generally, while the review of enforcement mechanisms is thorough, it does focus on national-level  mechanisms, and there is no significant analysis of enforcement at the state, municipal, or local level. The  United bid strategy does not include specific recommendations beyond the implementation of grievance  mechanisms outside of the context of official enforcement channels.  Quality of the Impacts Assessment Conducted  COMPREHENSIVENESS OF THE IMPACTS ANALYSED  Risks of negative human rights impacts associated with the organization of mega sporting events are  wide ranging, from forced labor and working condition violations in the construction of stadiums and  associated infrastructure to discrimination based on participants’ gender, race, and sexual orientation to  child labor and sexual harassment in the merchandise supply chain, to name a few. They also vary  across the phases of the event. It is commonly accepted that there are three distinct phases that can be  taken into consideration: preparation, staging, and legacy.  Based on the Independent Context Analysis, the United bid strategy examines a comprehensive range of  human rights risks and impacts through four perspectives—activities and locations, geographic context,  risks to people, and national context. The report identifies nine salient risk categories related to the  Competition and provides a comprehensive review:  » Discrimination (ethnicity, nationality, and religion;  indigenous populations; LGBTQ community; people  with disabilities; women and girls)  » Children  » Land Use and Housing Rights (availability of  affordable housing, community displacement, rough  sleeping, general concerns)  » Labor and Supply Chain (direct/contracted labor,  wage levels, FOA and collective bargaining,  discrimination, working hours, health & safety,  volunteers, child safeguarding, supply chain labor)  » Violence, Security, and Law Enforcement (hooliganism; violence or intimidation against players,  officials, and delegations; terrorism; gender-based violence and harassment; firearms; other security  concerns; security and law enforcement; global reach of security; surveillance; excessive use of  force by private or public security; profiling; protest; post-event usage of surveillance and  technology)  » Risks arising from international travel and movement (entry into North America, visa requirements,  travel between three host countries, secondary borders, surveillance and privacy)  BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  16  » Freedom of Expression and Assembly (restrictions on free speech / protections of free speech,  intimidation and violence against journalists)  » Privacy rights—players, spectators, consumers (protection of personal and financial data, player  privacy, internet and social media privacy, at borders, in public Wi-Fi networks)  » Other salient human rights risks (human trafficking, interference in civil and political rights / local  democracy)  Although the scope of impacts analyzed is comprehensive, reflects differentiated impacts on key rights- holder groups, and covers the different stages of the competition, we noted some differences between the  issues highlighted in the context analysis, those included in the salience analysis, and those covered as  part of the strategy and action plans without clear explanations.  ATTENTION TO RIGHT-HOLDERS  The UNGPs state that the process of identifying and assessing any actual or potential adverse human  rights impacts should involve meaningful consultation with potentially affected groups and other relevant  stakeholders, as appropriate to the nature and context of the operation. Rights-holders are indeed the  actual experts when it comes to deciding if they will be potentially negatively impacted by a project or  business activities—even though some groups may be unaware of their rights. When it comes to mega  sporting events, a broad set of right-holder groups can be at risk, from workers involved in construction  work to journalists, as well as volunteers, communities leaving near the event infrastructures, and even  football players.  Sample of Stakeholders Engaged   American Civil Liberties Union   Human Rights Watch     Fair Labor Association  AFL-CIO  International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers   U.S. International Council on Disabilities   International Labor Organization   Georgetown University School of Law   U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor  The analysis included in the report across the issues identified incorporates not just the review of the  national, state, and local legal frameworks, but also incorporates the results of stakeholder engagement,  which was conducted with interlocutors in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Stakeholders engaged  cover a comprehensive sampling of government agencies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and  academic institutions that provided additional feedback and analysis of the legal frameworks under  review, thereby enhancing conclusions made in the United bid strategy document.    BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  17  In addition, the Independent Context Analysis is built around broad categories of impacted rights-holders,  including workers and volunteers, communities, fans and spectators, players and officials, and journalists  and human rights defenders. The report also identifies particularly vulnerable rights-holder groups  impacted throughout the analysis, including indigenous populations, LGBTQ communities, people with  disabilities, migrants, women and girls, children. These vulnerable rights-holders have been identified  through stakeholder engagement with experts and representatives of these communities in Canada,  Mexico, and the United States. Throughout the Independent Context Analysis, vulnerable rights-holder  communities are identified where they may be negatively impacted by a lack of legal protections or forms  of discrimination.  PROPOSED IMPACT ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY  In traditional risk assessment, risk factors include both the consequences of an event (its severity) and its  probability. In the context of human rights risk, the interpretative guide of the UNGPs insists that severity  is the predominant factor; severity of impacts should be judged by their scale, scope, and remediable  character. Probability may then be relevant in helping prioritize the order in which potential impacts are  addressed in some circumstances. In addition, the UNGPs specifies that a proper due diligence approach  should consider actual and potential human rights impacts which are caused by the companies; impacts  that companies contributes to; and impacts that are directly linked to companies’ operations, products, or  services through business relationships, including both contractual and noncontractual relationships.  Finally, the UNGPs also insist on the importance of dialogue with potentially affected stakeholders  throughout the design, implementation, and review of impact assessment process.  The United bid strategy provides for a comprehensive review of nine salient risks that appear to be  comprehensive and robust in terms of considering potential impacts to rights-holders. However, the report  provides very little information on the risk-assessment methodology followed to identify salient impacts, in  particular the use of impact assessment indicators such as those proposed by the UNGPs: scale, scope,  and remediability. The report does not give any indication whether any alternative methodology was used  to conduct the salience analysis. It mentions that to prioritize actions with regard to preventing and  dealing with negative impacts, the United bid strategy identified the human rights and stakeholders most  likely to be impacted by the activities related to the organization and hosting of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.  Despite this lack of information, additional clarification received by the United Bid Committee indicates  that a more robust risk assessment and prioritization was used, though not clearly expressed in the bid  strategy. That risk assessment and prioritization processes apparently entailed:  1.  Identification of the total direct and indirect activities of a major sporting tournament, and  specifically the FIFA World Cup, including:  2.  Identification of the key rights-holders who are likely to be affected by these activities  3.  Identification of the key rights that would likely be impacted and how  4. Drafting of a shortlist of rights with a matrix setting out the rights / activities interaction  Furthermore, in clarifying this process, the United Bid Committee explained that in order to identify salient  risks, they took into account likelihood, severity, remoteness, and leverage from the tournament;  BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  18  remediability; and duration of impact. Finally, this list was further vetted by external stakeholders for  additional refinement.  This indicates that the committee engaged in the process of identifying potential risks utilizing a  comprehensive and consistent mapping of potential risks and impacts across all phases of the  Competition using an analysis framework consistent with that articulated by the UNGPs.      BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  19  Engaging Stakeholders on Human Rights  The level of engagement of stakeholders in the United bid is very good.  The United team has implemented a robust engagement of nearly 60  stakeholders from government, academia, and international and local-level  NGOs in each of three countries included in the bid. Throughout the report,  incorporation of stakeholder feedback in the analysis of potential risks and  impacts is evident, and there is a good level of consideration given to  vulnerable groups. However, it is not clear how stakeholders were  prioritized so as to ensure a robust engagement with those most at risk of  being negatively impacted and the most vulnerable.  Quality of the Mapping of the Stakeholders  CATEGORIES OF STAKEHOLDERS CONSIDERED  Stakeholders can be defined as any individual who may affect or be affected by an organization’s  activities including operations, products, or services. Stakeholders to the FIFA 2026 World Cup are likely  to be wide ranging from volunteers and fans participating in the competition to contract workers in the  merchandise supply chains. They can also be vocal and influential, such as prominent international  human rights NGOs or trade unions, or more vulnerable and not voicing their concerns or even unaware  of their rights, such as local communities evicted for construction of infrastructures or migrant workers.  Engaging with potentially affected stakeholder groups is essential to ensure the legitimacy, quality, and  ultimate effectiveness of the company’s approach.  The United bid strategy engaged stakeholders at the community, national, and international levels in  order to identify salient risks and create the mitigation strategy across the various stages of the  competition.  The United bid strategy mentions that 30 stakeholders were engaged throughout the bid development  process, including governmental, academic, and NGO stakeholders. However, upon request, the United  Bid Committee provided the full list of 57 stakeholders engaged. Stakeholders included in this longer list  represents a diverse and representative sample of stakeholders and rights-holders potentially impacted  by the competition.        BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  20  Stakeholders Engagement as Part of the United Bid  Based in Canada  Based in Mexico  Based in the United States  Other  Privaterra  Azteca Foundation  Human Rights  Danish Institute for  World Players  Canadian Center for  Centro de Análisis e  Athlete Ally  Access Now  Building and Wood  Campaign (HRC)  Human Rights  Association at UNI  Global Union  Ethics in Sport  Investicación—FUNDAR  Indigenous Sport,  CEREAL  Human Rights First  PEN America  Physical Activity and  Recreation Council  (ISPARC)  Workers’  International  Institute for  Human Rights and  Business (IHRB)  Egale Canada  Comisión Mexicana de  Business & Human  American Civil Liberties  ILO  Defensa y Promoción de  Rights Resource  Union (ACLU)  los Derechos Humanos  Center  AthletesCan  Comunicación e  Human Rights Watch  UN Women  Oak Foundation  Información de la Mujer  AC—CIMAC  Canadian Civil  Concepto Total  Accountability Counsel Embassy of Canada  Human Rights  Liberties Association  (CCLA)  Watch  National Women  Embajada de EUA en  International  Embassy of Mexico  México, Asuntos  Corporate  Educativos y Culturales  Accountability  Roundtable (ICAR)  Equidad MX  Committee to Protect  U.S. Department of  Journalists (CPI)  State  Heinrich Boell Foundation Washington Office for  NYU Stern Business  Instituto para las Mujeres  Fair Labor Association  TIDES  Latin America (WOLA)  School  en la Migración AC— IMUMI  Responsabilidad Social  AFL-CIO  Georgetown University  Empresarial  Revitaliza Consultores— U.S. General Services  LEED Consultants  Administration  Sales Boyoli Law firm— International  Corporate and Labor  Association of  Machinists and  Aerospace Workers /  Georgetown Law  School  Solidarity Center  U.S. International  Council on Disabilities  Televisa Foundation  UNICEF  UN Women.org  Open Society  Foundation                                                  BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  21  IDENTIFICATION OF VULNERABLE GROUPS  Companies are required to give particular attention to the rights and needs of, as well as the challenges  faced by, individuals from groups or populations that may be at heightened risk of becoming vulnerable or  marginalized, and with due regard to the different risks that may be faced by women and men in  particular. This specific identification and engagement of the most vulnerable stakeholders is important  because the political and socio-economic context and overall risk context can vary significantly for certain  vulnerable groups compared to the majority of the population.  Throughout the report, awareness of vulnerable groups is demonstrated in the analysis, commitments  and Strategy. Specifically, the report clearly states that where potentially adverse impacts on the human  rights of people belonging to specific groups or populations, the United team has considered other  international standards and principles that elaborate on the rights of such individuals, including standards  concerning indigenous peoples, migrant workers and their families, national, ethnic and religious  minorities, people with disabilities, women, race, LGBTQ, journalists, and human rights defenders. The  action plan of the United bid strategy further articulates the potential impacts on each of these vulnerable  groups per category of impacts identified (e.g., discrimination, housing rights, etc.), thereby identifying  how these vulnerable groups may be affected in different situations.  Although the scope of identified vulnerable groups is comprehensive, it is unclear whether there has been  a formal process by which vulnerable groups were mapped, identified, and prioritized.  PRIORITIZATION OF THE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGED  In the literature on stakeholder engagement it is often suggested that companies rely on criteria such as  level expertise of stakeholders and their respective influence on success and failure of a given project.  However, a robust human rights-based approach requires that the risk stakeholders face of being  negatively impacted as well as the severity of the impact must be considered. This allows companies to  identify not only the most influential stakeholders but also other affected groups, in particular the most  vulnerable. Other criteria can include legitimacy of the stakeholder group, their willingness to engage, and  whether they have direct contact to affected and vulnerable groups.  The report explains that working with stakeholders in the process of creating the human rights portion of  this bid powerfully demonstrated that through collaboration and shared ownership of the process and  results, success and lasting progressive change can be built. While there is clear evidence of a robust  level of engagement with a long list of stakeholders, there is no specific comment made about the  importance of prioritizing engagement with right-holders that are at risk of being most impacted or are  most vulnerable. There is also limited information given about the process of prioritizing and assessing  the expertise and influence of these stakeholders and how this was taken into consideration in the  engagement strategy.  Quality of the Engagement With Stakeholders  TYPE AND ADEQUACY OF ENGAGEMENT  In the context of the UNGPs, stakeholder engagement refers to an ongoing process of interaction and  dialogue between an enterprise and its potentially affected stakeholders that enables the enterprise to  hear, understand, and respond to their interests and concerns, including through collaborative  approaches. The UNGPs also give some guidance on which forms of engagement are preferred in the  BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  22  context of human rights due diligence and emphasize that companies need to go beyond a singular event  or unilateral communication. In order to meaningfully inform due diligence and mitigation and remediation  strategies, stakeholder engagement processes should be inclusive, participatory, accessible, transparent,  credible, culturally appropriate, context-specific, and gender-sensitive.  The report articulates a number of ways in which stakeholder engagement was conducted. It notes that  the stakeholder engagement process was conducted in line with the AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement  Standard. Stakeholder Engagement activities appear to have included one-on-one consultations,  consultations with leadership from all candidate host cities, and involvement and collaboration via multi- stakeholder workshops. In addition, two facilitated multi-stakeholder forums were held in January 2018 in  New York and Washington, D.C., with 30 domestic and global human rights organizations and three  governments represented. An additional forum was conducted in Mexico City in March 2018. In these  forums, stakeholder feedback and proposals on the following subjects was sought:  » Evaluation of human rights risk assessment  » Discussion on standards and best practices to address gaps or risks  » Ongoing due diligence processes  » Procurement policy  » Effective grievance mechanisms and best practice  » Opportunities for human rights legacy, and  » Next steps and roadmap ahead  However, while these types of interactions seem adequate to prepare for the competition, there is limited  supportive documentation that could justify the level of interaction and feedback presented by  stakeholders and how that feedback has been incorporated. In addition, it is unclear whether the  mechanisms described are adequate to meaningfully engage some of the most vulnerable stakeholders.  ENGAGEMENT WITH VULNERABLE GROUPS  Engaging vulnerable groups may require specific engagement options because they can be extremely  poor, illiterate, and not necessarily accustomed to traditional modes of engagement (e.g., workshops,  webinars, etc.). In addition, while the UNGPs expect processes that are inclusive, participatory,  accessible, transparent, credible, culturally appropriate, context-specific, and gender-sensitive, direct  engagement should be prioritized provided it does not endanger people’s human rights. In the latter case,  reasonable alternatives can be sought in case direct engagement is not possible. Such alternatives can  be engagement with representatives of affected groups, human rights experts, trade unions, community  organizations, or international organizations. While the United bid documents do not make clear that  systematic direct engagement with vulnerable groups took place, their voices are well represented  through the stakeholder engagement process.  Examples of stakeholders that may represent the voice of vulnerable groups that were engaged as part of  the bid process include:  BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  23  Canada  Name  Indigenous  Sport,  Physical  Activity &  Recreation  Council  (ISPARC)  Mexico  United States  Category  Name  Category  Name  Indigenous  Communities  Human Rights  Campaign  Indigenous  Rights  Comisión  Mexicana de  Defensa y  Promoción de  los Derechos  Humanos  Category  LGBTQ  Egale Canada  LGBTQ  Women’s  Rights  Comunicación  e Información  de la Mujer  AC—CIMAC  Athlete Ally  LGBTQ  National  Women  Women’s  Rights  Equidad MX  LGBTQ  Instituto para  las Mujeres en  la Migración  AC— IMUMI  Women’s  Rights and  Migrants  Persons with  Disabilities  U.S.  International  Council on  Disabilities  UNICEF  Children’s  Rights  UN Women  Women’s  Rights                  BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  24  Addressing Human Rights Risks  The public commitment and proposal to address human rights risks and  remedy potential negative impacts are very good overall and well aligned  with expectations set in the UNGPs. In particular, report commits to  ongoing due diligence, remediating human rights impacts, providing  effective grievance mechanisms, and remaining transparent throughout  these processes. The Strategy clearly benefited from a robust level of  engagement and input from stakeholder and identifies areas where  additional engagement with local stakeholders, such as municipal and city  government, is necessary for the purposes of the mitigation strategy.  Quality of the Human Rights Management Systems  ROBUSTNESS OF THE PUBLIC COMMITMENT  The UNGPs explain that as the basis for embedding their responsibility to respect human rights,  companies should express their commitment to meet this responsibility through a statement of policy that:  (a) Is approved at the most senior level of the business enterprise;  (b) Is informed by relevant internal and/or external expertise;  (c) Stipulates the enterprise’s human rights expectations of personnel, business partners, and other  parties directly linked to its operations, products, or services;  (d) Is publicly available and communicated internally and externally to all personnel, business partners,  and other relevant parties;  (e) Is reflected in operational policies and procedures necessary to embed it throughout the business  enterprise.  This public commitment is important in the context of the FIFA World Cup as it sets out expectations to  embed human rights considerations in the preparation, hosting, and legacy phases, not only for the  football Member Association but also for all potential partners as well as for governments.  The United bid’s public commitment articulates a comprehensive policy commitment that is publically  available with sign-off from the United Bid Committee and includes the following elements:  BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  25  » The United team commits to respecting human rights in all aspects of its work before, during, and  after the staging of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and defines human rights to include those contained  in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (“UDHR”), the International Covenant on Civil and  Political Rights (“ICCPR”), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights  (“ICESCR), and the principles set out in the International Labor Organization’s Declaration on  Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.  » The United team further commits to proactively avoiding human rights abuses by the actions of the  committee and its business partners, and where impacts are identified, commits to taking measures  to mitigate and remediate those impacts where they arise.  » The United team emphasizes its areas of biggest risk as identified through a due diligence that  includes the perspective of external experts and stakeholders, including equal opportunity and  inclusivity; child safeguarding; freedom of expression and assembly; labor rights; land acquisition;  international travel and movement; privacy rights; and security.  » Finally, the United team commits to communicate to everyone associated with its bid activities—from  the board of directors to human rights stakeholders—the expectations embedded in the  commitment, in addition to embedding them in all contracts and policies associated with the  Competition.  This detailed commitment fully satisfies all expectations of the UNGPs, but it could be further supported  with integration of the following elements in the Strategy going forward:  » Hierarchy of respect for international human rights principles where local law does offer the same  protections as international law  » Clearly delineated “show-stoppers” and zero-tolerance areas for interactions with business partners  » Clear governance structure for human rights issues  » Commitment to continually updating the human rights approach  COMPREHENSIVENESS OF THE DUE DILIGENCE MEASURES  PROPOSED  The UNGPs state that in order to identify, prevent, mitigate, and account for how they address their  adverse human rights impacts, business enterprises should carry out human rights due diligence. This  process:  (a) Should cover adverse human rights impacts that the business enterprise may cause or contribute  to through its own activities, or which may be directly linked to its operations, products, or services by its  business relationships;  (b) Will vary in complexity with the size of the business enterprise, the risk of severe human rights  impacts, and the nature and context of its operations;  (c) Should be ongoing, recognizing that the human rights risks may change over time as the business  enterprise’s operations and operating context evolve.    BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  26  Through human rights due diligence, the Member Association will identify the information needed to  understand the specific human rights risks associated with hosting the FIFA World Cup (through the three  phases described in the prior sections) as well as the actions it needs to take to prevent and mitigate  them.  The UNGPs states that where business enterprises identify that they have caused or contributed to  adverse impacts, they should provide for or cooperate in their remediation through legitimate processes.  Remediation can take a variety of forms: an apology, provisions to ensure negative impacts will not recur,  compensation (financial or other, e.g., in case of land acquisition) for the harm, cessation of a particular  activity or relationship with a business partner, etc. To ensure adequate remediation is given, it is  important to set up effective grievance mechanisms for affected rights-holders  The United bid Human Rights Strategy provides detail on each gap identified across 12 risk areas and as  well as the action plan to mitigate and remediate those gaps. Remediation measures take into  consideration stakeholder feedback as well as the findings of the Independent Context Analysis and are  therefore comprehensive in nature. Each element of the mitigation strategy for the 12 risk areas identified  appears sufficient to mitigate the identified risk and can be assessed as having very good quality when  compared to the level or risk identified.  The key elements of the mitigation strategy are:  1. Embed the commitments articulated in the 2026 bid  2. Identify, prevent, and remedy risks at each host city level  3. Exercise leverage  4. Track, verify, and account for effectiveness of measures taken  5. Grievance mechanisms are put into place  These elements are embedded into the mitigation and remediation strategy for each risk identified and  therefore create a comprehensive and strong mitigation strategy.  QUALITY OF THE REMEDIATION MEASURES PROPOSED  The UNGPs states that where business enterprises identify that they have caused or contributed to  adverse impacts, they should provide for or cooperate in their remediation through legitimate processes.  Remediation can take a variety of forms: an apology, provisions to ensure negative impacts will not recur,  compensation (financial or other, e.g., in case of land acquisition) for the harm, cessation of a particular  activity or relationship with a business partner, etc. To ensure adequate remediation is given, it is  important to set up effective grievance mechanisms for affected rights-holders.  The report outlines the United Bid Committee’s proposed approach to implementing grievance  mechanisms across all phases of the Competition. The bid committee states that its goal is to create,  along with FIFA, grievance mechanisms for all stakeholders that have been negatively impacted by  activities related to the competition. The committee commits to prioritize publicizing these mechanisms so  that they are known to all, and to ensure trust in their effectiveness. Additionally, the bid committee  BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  27  commits to work with FIFA to develop a framework to ensure existing mechanisms are aligned with any  public or state-based judicial and nonjudicial mechanisms, fortified (as needed), and gaps filled.  Grievance mechanisms to fill gaps are expected to be designed to ensure fulfillment of the effectiveness  criteria set out in Principle 31 of the UNGPs.  Throughout the United bid strategy and as part of the Action Plan commitments in particular, the role of  grievance mechanisms for each of the individual risks identified for remediation and mitigation is  emphasized. The detailed action plan for each grievance mechanism responding to a particular risk (e.g.,  land use, wage and hour, etc.) appear to meet the requirements of Principle 31 of the UNGPs, which  require grievance mechanisms to be legitimate, accessible, predictable, equitable, transparent, rights- compatible, a source of continuous learning, and developed through engagement and dialogue. While  each of these elements are not fully articulated within each subsection of the Action Plan, overall the  proposed mechanisms meet these principles.  Quality of the Stakeholders Input in the Human Rights  Strategy  STAKEHOLDER INPUT TO DATE  Stakeholder engagement—including with vulnerable rights-holder groups—is essential to identify impacts  through the three phases of the FIFA World Cup and to define mitigation measures effectively. This is  also an important dimension to guarantee that the actions proposed by the Member Association are  legitimate and credible.  The report makes a general comment that the assessment of risks corresponding to activities directly or  indirectly associated with the 2026 FIFA World Cup were based on the information received, and  consultation with over 60 human rights experts and stakeholders in the three countries and worldwide. It  then further articulates a number of ways in which stakeholder engagement was conducted and input  received. It notes that the stakeholder engagement process was conducted in line with the AA1000  Stakeholder Engagement Standard. Stakeholder Engagement activities appear to have included one-on- one consultations, consultations with leadership from all candidate host cities, and involvement and  collaboration via multi-stakeholder workshops as well as two facilitated multi-stakeholder forums.  In addition, the bid documents mention that the outputs of the stakeholder engagement process included  a refined list of risk areas for the national context for all three countries; specific information regarding  risks, existing due diligence processes, and grievance mechanisms in candidate host cities; and an  assessment of risks and proposals subsequently incorporated into the Human Rights Strategy.  However, the report is lacking supportive document (e.g., minutes) that would provide further evidence of  the level of interaction and feedback presented by stakeholders and how that feedback has been  incorporated.  FORSEEN STAKEHOLDER INPUT  Beyond identification of salient human rights risks, stakeholders’ input can help define innovative  solutions to address negative human rights impacts as well as promote human rights through the  competition. Continuous engagement will also be essential to legitimize the approach the Member  Association will build over the next eight years.  BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  28  The strategy makes clear the intention of the bid committee to continue the integration of stakeholder  engagement into the governance, strategy, and operational processes of United bid 2026, with clearly  defined roles and responsibilities, including the design and establishment of relevant and appropriate  grievance mechanisms, the creation of policies and processes to address risks to potentially affected  groups, training to build capacity to implement policies and processes—and assistance with monitoring of  and adherence to human rights standards on an ongoing basis.  This demonstrates a robust commitment to including the stakeholder voice throughout the stages of the  Competition and into the mitigation and remediation effort, an important step beyond stakeholder  engagement efforts at the outset.      BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  29  Conclusions  FIFA set an important milestone by including human rights responsibilities  in article 3 of its statutes and by developing human rights requirements for  the 2026 Football World Cup.  This report is intended to help the FIFA Council and Congress to take  human rights considerations into account when allocating the 2026 Football  World Cup, alongside other criteria such as infrastructural and commercial  potential. In line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human  Rights, we have addressed human rights questions in our evaluation  mainly through the narrow lens of preventing negative impacts (the “Do No  Harm” approach). Beyond this, the bid team may voluntarily commit to  actively promoting certain human rights (the “Do Good” approach), using  the FIFA Competition as an opportunity to enhance or further a culture of  human rights in host countries.      BSR | United Bid – Evaluation Report of the Human Rights Strategy  30  About BSR  BSR is a global nonprofit organization that works with its network of more than  250 member companies and other partners to build a just and sustainable world.
