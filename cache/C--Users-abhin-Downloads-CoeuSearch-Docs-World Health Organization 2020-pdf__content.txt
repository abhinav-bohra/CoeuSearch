The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the  fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race,  religion, political belief, economic or social condition.  The health of all peoples is fundamental to the attainment of peace and  security and is dependent upon the fullest co-operation of individuals  and States.  The achievement of any State in the promotion and protection of health  is of value to all.  Unequal development in different countries in the promotion of health  and control of disease, especially communicable disease, is a common  danger.  Healthy development of the child is of basic importance; the ability to  live harmoniously in a changing total environment is essential to such  development.  The extension to all peoples of the benefits of medical, psychological  and related knowledge is essential to the fullest attainment of health.  Informed opinion and active co-operation on the part of the public are  of the utmost importance in the improvement of the health of the people.  Governments have a responsibility for the health of their peoples which  can be fulfilled only by the provision of adequate health and social  measures.  ACCEPTING THESE PRINCIPLES, and for the purpose of co-operation  among themselves and with others to promote and protect the health of all  peoples, the Contracting Parties agree to the present Constitution and hereby  establish the World Health Organization as a specialized agency within the  terms of Article    of the Charter of the United Nations.  _________    The Constitution was adopted by the International Health Conference held in New York from    June  to    July     , signed on    July      by the representatives of    States (Off.

Section     Where the incidence of any form of taxation depends upon residence,  periods during which the representatives of members of the specialized  agencies at meetings convened by them are present in a Member State for  the discharge of their duties shall not be considered as periods of residence.                BASIC DOCUMENTS  Section     Privileges and immunities are accorded to the representatives of  members, not for the personal benefit of the individuals themselves, but in  order to safeguard the independent exercise of their functions in connexion  with the specialized agencies. Consequently, a member not only has the  right but is under a duty to waive the immunity of its representatives in any  case where, in the opinion of the member, the immunity would impede the  course of justice, and where it can be waived without prejudice to the  purpose for which the immunity is accorded.

Should other officials of specialized agencies be called up for national  service, the State concerned shall, at the request of the specialized agency  concerned, grant such temporary deferments in the call-up of such officials  as may be necessary to avoid interruption in the continuation of essential  work.  Section     In addition to the immunities and privileges specified in sections    and    , the executive head of each specialized agency, including any official  acting on his behalf during his absence from duty, shall be accorded in  respect of himself, his spouse and minor children, the privileges and  immunities, exemptions and facilities accorded to diplomatic envoys, in  accordance with international law.  Section     Privileges and immunities are granted to officials in the interests of the  specialized agencies only and not for the personal benefit of the individuals  themselves. Each specialized agency shall have the right and the duty to  waive the immunity of any official in any case where, in its opinion, the                BASIC DOCUMENTS  immunity would impede the course of justice and can be waived without  prejudice to the interests of the specialized agency.  Section     Each specialized agency shall co-operate at all times with the  appropriate authorities of Member States  the proper  administration of justice, secure the observance of police regulations and  prevent the occurrence of any abuses in connexion with the privileges,  immunities and facilities mentioned in this article.  to facilitate  Article VII – Abuses of Privilege  Section     If any State party to this Convention considers that there has been an  abuse of a privilege or immunity conferred by this Convention,  consultations shall be held between that State and the specialized agency  concerned to determine whether any such abuse has occurred and, if so, to  attempt to ensure that no repetition occurs. If such consultations fail to  achieve a result satisfactory to the State and the specialized agency  concerned, the question whether an abuse of a privilege or immunity has  occurred shall be submitted to the International Court of Justice in  accordance with section   . If the International Court of Justice finds that  such an abuse has occurred, the State party to this Convention affected by  such abuse shall have the right, after notification to the specialized agency  in question, to withhold from the specialized agency concerned the benefits  of the privilege or immunity so abused.  Section      . Representatives of members at meetings convened by specialized  agencies, while exercising their functions and during their journeys to and  from the place of meeting, and officials within the meaning of section   ,  shall not be required by the territorial authorities to leave the country in  which they are performing their functions on account of any activities by  them in their official capacity. In the case, however, of abuse of privileges  of residence committed by any such person in activities in that country  outside his official functions, he may be required to leave by the  Government of that country provided that:   . (I) Representatives of members, or persons who are entitled to  diplomatic immunity under section   , shall not be required to leave the            CONVENTION ON PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES      country otherwise than in accordance with the diplomatic procedure  applicable to diplomatic envoys accredited to that country.  (II) In the case of an official to whom section    is not applicable, no  order to leave the country shall be issued other than with the approval of the  Foreign Minister of the country in question, and such approval shall be  given only after consultation with the executive head of the specialized  agency concerned; and, if expulsion proceedings are taken against an  official, the executive head of the specialized agency shall have the right to  appear in such proceedings on behalf of the person against whom they are  instituted.  Article VIII – Laissez-passer  Section     Officials of the specialized agencies shall be entitled to use the United  Nations laissez-passer in conformity with administrative arrangements to  be concluded between the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the  competent authorities of the specialized agencies, to which agencies special  powers to issue laissez-passer may be delegated. The Secretary-General of  the United Nations shall notify each State party to this Convention of each  administrative arrangement so concluded.  Section     States parties to this Convention shall recognize and accept the United  Nations laissez-passer issued to officials of the specialized agencies as valid  travel documents.  Section     Applications for visas, where required, from officials of specialized  agencies holding United Nations laissez-passer, when accompanied by a  certificate that they are travelling on the business of a specialized agency,  shall be dealt with as speedily as possible. In addition, such persons shall be  granted facilities for speedy travel.  Section     Similar facilities to those specified in section    shall be accorded to  experts and other persons who, though not the holders of United Nations  laissez-passer, have a certificate that they are travelling on the business of  a specialized agency.                BASIC DOCUMENTS  Section     The executive heads, assistant executive heads, heads of departments  and other officials of a rank not lower than head of department of the  specialized agencies, travelling on United Nations laissez-passer on the  business of the specialized agencies, shall be granted the same facilities for  travel as are accorded to officials of comparable rank in diplomatic missions.  Article IX – Settlement of Disputes  Section     Each specialized agency shall make provision for appropriate modes of  settlement of:  (a) Disputes arising out of contracts or other disputes of private character to  which the specialized agency is a party;  (b) Disputes involving any official of a specialized agency who by reason  of his official position enjoys immunity, if immunity has not been  waived in accordance with the provisions of section   .  Section     All differences arising out of the interpretation or application of the  present Convention shall be referred to the International Court of Justice  unless in any case it is agreed by the parties to have recourse to another  mode of settlement. If a difference arises between one of the specialized  agencies on the one hand, and a member on the other hand, a request shall  be made for an advisory opinion on any legal question involved in  accordance with Article    of the Charter and Article    of the Statute of  the Court and the relevant provisions of the agreements concluded between  the United Nations and the specialized agency concerned. The opinion  given by the Court shall be accepted as decisive by the parties.  Article X – Annexes and Application to Individual  Specialized Agencies  Section     In their application to each specialized agency, the standard clauses shall  operate subject to any modifications set forth in the final (or revised) text of  the annex relating to that agency, as provided in sections    and   .            CONVENTION ON PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES      Section     The provisions of the Convention in relation to any specialized agency  must be interpreted in the light of the functions with which that agency is  entrusted by its constitutional instrument.

The  Secretary-General shall communicate to all Members of the United Nations  and to other States members of the specialized agencies certified copies of  all annexes transmitted to him under this section and of revised annexes  transmitted under section   .

Section     It is understood that the standard clauses, as modified by the final text  of an annex sent by a specialized agency to the Secretary-General of the  United Nations under section    (or any revised annex sent under section    ), will be consistent with the provisions of the constitutional instrument  then in force of the agency in question, and that if any amendment to that  instrument is necessary for the purpose of making the constitutional  instrument so consistent, such amendment will have been brought into force  in accordance with the constitutional procedure of that agency before the  final (or revised) annex is transmitted.  The Convention shall not itself operate so as to abrogate, or derogate  from, any provisions of the constitutional instrument of any specialized  agency or any rights or obligations which the agency may otherwise have,  acquire, or assume.

The overarching framework of engagement with non-State actors and  the WHO policy and operational procedures on management of engagement  with non-State actors apply to all engagements with non-State actors at all  levels of the Organization,   whereas the four specific policies and  operational procedures on engagement are limited in application to,  respectively, nongovernmental organizations, private sector entities,  philanthropic foundations and academic institutions.  ENGAGEMENT: RATIONALE, PRINCIPLES, BENEFITS AND RISKS  Rationale   . WHO is the directing and coordinating authority in global health in line  with its constitutional mandate. The global health landscape has become  more complex in many respects; among other things, there has been an  increase in the number of players including non-State actors. WHO engages  with non-State actors in view of their significant role in global health for the  advancement and promotion of public health and to encourage non-State  actors to use their own activities to protect and promote public health.   . The functions of WHO, as set out in Article   of its Constitution, include:  to act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health  work; to establish and maintain effective collaboration with diverse  organizations; and  to promote cooperation among scientific and  professional groups which contribute to the advancement of health. The  Constitution further mandates the Health Assembly or the Executive Board,  and the Director-General, to enter into specific engagements with other  organizations.   WHO shall, in relation to non-State actors, act in  conformity with its Constitution and resolutions and decisions of the Health  Assembly, and bearing in mind those of the United Nations General  _________    See resolution WHA  .   (    ).    Headquarters, regional offices and country offices, entities established under WHO, as well as hosted  partnerships. For hosted partnerships the Framework of Engagement with Non-State Actors will apply,  subject to the policy on WHO’s engagement with global health partnerships and hosting arrangements  (resolution WHA  .  ). Hosted, as well as external partnerships are explained in paragraph   .    WHO Constitution, Articles   ,   ,    and   .  –    –          BASIC DOCUMENTS  Assembly or the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, if  applicable.   . WHO’s engagement with non-State actors supports implementation of  the Organization’s policies and recommendations as decided by the  governing bodies, as well as the application of WHO’s technical norms and  standards. Such an effective engagement with non-State actors at global,  regional and country levels, also calls for due diligence and transparency  measures applicable to non-State actors under this framework. In order to  be able to strengthen its engagement with non-State actors for the benefit  and interest of global public health, WHO needs simultaneously to  strengthen its management of the associated potential risks. This requires a  robust framework that enables engagement and serves also as an instrument  to identify the risks, balancing them against the expected benefits, while  protecting and preserving WHO’s integrity, reputation and public health  mandate.  Principles   . WHO’s engagement with non-State actors is guided by the following  overarching principles.   Any engagement must:  (a) demonstrate a clear benefit to public health;  (b) conform with WHO’s Constitution, mandate and General  Programme of Work  the  (c) respect  the  decision-making authority of Member States as set out in the WHO’s  Constitution;  intergovernmental nature of WHO and  (d) support and enhance, without compromising, the scientific and  evidence-based approach that underpins WHO’s work;  (e) protect WHO from any undue influence, in particular on the  processes in setting and applying policies, norms and standards;   (f) not compromise WHO’s integrity, independence, credibility and  reputation;  (g) be effectively managed, including by, where possible avoiding  conflict of interest  and other forms of risks to WHO;  _________    Policies, norms and standard setting includes information gathering, preparation for, elaboration of  and the decision on the normative text.    As set out in paragraphs   –  .            FRAMEWORK OF ENGAGEMENT WITH NON-STATE ACTORS      (h) be conducted on the basis of transparency, openness, inclusiveness,  accountability, integrity and mutual respect.  Benefits of engagement   . WHO’s engagement with non-State actors can bring important benefits  to global public health and to the Organization itself in fulfilment of its  constitutional principles and objectives, including its directing and  coordinating role in global health. Engagements range from major,  longer-term collaborations to smaller, briefer interactions. Benefits arising  from such engagement can also include:  (a) the contribution of non-State actors to the work of WHO  (b) the influence that WHO can have on non-State actors to enhance  their impact on global public health or to influence the social, economic  and environmental determinants of health  (c) the influence that WHO can have on non-State actors’ compliance  with WHO’s policies, norms and standards  (d) the additional resources non-State actors can contribute to WHO’s  work  (e) the wider dissemination of and adherence by non-State actors to  WHO’s policies, norms and standards  Risks of engagement   . WHO’s engagement with non-State actors can involve risks which need  to be effectively managed and, where appropriate, avoided. Risks relate  inter alia to the occurrence in particular of the following:  (a) conflicts of interest;  (b) undue or improper influence exercised by a non-State actor on  WHO’s work, especially in, but not limited to, policies, norms and  standard setting;   (c) a negative impact on WHO’s integrity, independence, credibility and  reputation; and public health mandate;  (d) the engagement being primarily used to serve the interests of the  non-State actor concerned with limited or no benefits for WHO and  public health;  _________    Policies, norms and standard setting includes information gathering, preparation for, elaboration of  and the decision on the normative text.                 BASIC DOCUMENTS  (e) the engagement conferring an endorsement of the non-State actor’s  name, brand, product, views or activity;   (f) the whitewashing of a non-State actor’s image through an  engagement with WHO;  (g) a competitive advantage for a non-State actor.  NON-STATE ACTORS  the purpose of  framework, non-State actors are   . For  nongovernmental organizations, private sector entities, philanthropic  foundations and academic institutions.  this   . Nongovernmental organizations are non-profit entities that operate  independently of governments. They are usually membership-based, with  non-profit entities or individuals as members exercising voting rights in  relation to the policies of the nongovernmental organization, or are  otherwise constituted with non-profit, public-interest goals. They are free  from concerns which are primarily of a private, commercial or  profit-making nature. They could include, for example, grassroots  community organizations, civil society groups and networks, faith-based  organizations, professional groups, disease-specific groups, and patient  groups.    . Private sector entities are commercial enterprises, that is to say  businesses that are intended to make a profit for their owners. The term also  refers to entities that represent, or are governed or controlled by, private  sector entities. This group includes (but is not limited to) business  associations representing commercial enterprises, entities not “at arm’s  length”  from their commercial sponsors, and partially or fully State-owned  commercial enterprises acting like private sector entities.  International business associations are private sector entities that do not  intend to make a profit for themselves but represent the interests of their  members, which are commercial enterprises and/or national or other  business associations. For the purposes of this framework, they shall have  the authority to speak for their members through their authorized  representatives. Their members shall exercise voting rights in relation to the  policies of the international business association.  _________    Endorsement does not include established processes such as prequalifications or the WHO Pesticide  Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES).    An entity is “at arm’s length” from another entity if it is independent from the other entity, does not  take instructions and is clearly not influenced or clearly not reasonably perceived to be influenced in its  decisions and work by the other entity.            FRAMEWORK OF ENGAGEMENT WITH NON-STATE ACTORS         . Philanthropic foundations are non-profit entities whose assets are  provided by donors and whose income is spent on socially useful purposes.  They shall be clearly independent from any private sector entity in their  governance and decision-making.    . Academic institutions are entities engaged in the pursuit and  dissemination of knowledge through research, education and training.     . For each of the four groups of entities above, the overarching framework  and the respective specific policy on engagement apply. WHO will  determine through its due diligence if a non-State actor is subject to the  influence of private sector entities to the extent that the non-State actor has  to be considered itself a private sector entity. Such influence can be exerted  through financing, participation in decision making or otherwise. Provided  that the decision-making processes and bodies of a non-State actor remain  independent of undue influence from the private sector, WHO can decide to  consider the entity as a nongovernmental organization, a philanthropic  foundation or an academic institution, but may apply relevant provisions of  the WHO’s policy and operational procedures on engagement with private  sector entities, such as not accepting financial and in-kind contributions for  use in the normative work.  TYPES OF INTERACTION    . The following are categories of interaction in which WHO engages with  non-State actors. Each type of interaction can take different forms, be  subject to different levels of risk and can involve different levels and types  of engagement by the Organization.  Participation    . Non-State actors may attend various types of meetings organized by  WHO. The nature of their participation depends on the type of meeting  concerned. The format, modalities, and the participation of non-State actors  in consultations, hearings, and other meetings is decided on a case-by-case  basis by the WHO governing bodies or by the Secretariat.  (a) Meetings of the governing bodies. This type involves sessions of  the World Health Assembly, the Executive Board and the six regional  committees. Non-State actors’ participation is determined by the  governing bodies’ respective rules of procedure, policies and practices  as well as the section of this framework that deals with official relations.  _________    This can include think tanks which are policy-oriented institutions, as long as they primarily perform  institutions are considered as nongovernmental  research; international associations of academic  organizations, subject to paragraph   .                 BASIC DOCUMENTS  (b) Consultations. This type includes any physical or virtual meeting,  other than governing body sessions, organized for the purpose of  exchanging information and views. Inputs received from non-State  actors shall be made publicly available, wherever possible.  (c) Hearings. These are meetings in which the participants can present  their evidence, views and positions and be questioned about them but do  not enter into a debate. Hearings can be electronic or in person. All  interested entities should be invited on the same basis. The participants  and positions presented during hearings shall be documented and shall  be made publicly available, wherever possible.  (d) Other meetings. These are meetings that are not part of the process  of setting policies, norms or standards; examples include information  for  meetings, briefings, scientific conferences, and platforms  coordination of actors.    . WHO’s involvement in meetings organized wholly or partly by a  non-State actor can – subject to the provisions of this framework, its four  specific policies and operational procedures, and other applicable WHO  rules, policies and procedures – consist of any one of the following  possibilities:  • WHO jointly organizes the meeting with the non-State actor  • WHO cosponsors a meeting  organized by the non-State actor  • WHO staff make a presentation or act as panellists at a meeting  organized by the non-State actor  • WHO staff attend a meeting organized by a non-State actor.  Resources    . Resources are financial or in-kind contributions. In-kind contributions  include donations of medicines and other goods and free provision of  services  on a contractual basis.  Evidence    . For the purposes of this framework, evidence refers to inputs based on  up-to-date information, knowledge on technical issues, and consideration of  scientific facts, independently analysed by WHO. Evidence generation by  _________    Cosponsorship of a meeting means: ( ) another entity has the primary responsibility for organizing  the meeting; and ( ) WHO supports and contributes to the meeting and its proceedings; and ( ) WHO  reserves the right to clear the agenda of the meeting, the list of participants and the outcome documents of  the meeting.    With the exception of secondments, which are covered in paragraph   .            FRAMEWORK OF ENGAGEMENT WITH NON-STATE ACTORS       WHO includes information gathering, analysis, generation of information  and the management of knowledge and research. Non-State actors may  provide their up-to-date information and knowledge on technical issues, and  share their experience with WHO, as appropriate, subject to the provisions  of this framework, its four specific policies and operational procedures, and  other applicable WHO rules, policies and procedures. Such contribution  should be made publicly available, as appropriate, wherever possible.  Scientific evidence generated should be made publicly available.  Advocacy    . Advocacy is action to increase awareness of health issues, including  issues that receive insufficient attention; to change behaviours in the interest  of public health; and to foster collaboration and greater coherence between  non-State actors where joint action is required.  Technical collaboration    . For the purpose of this framework, technical collaboration refers to other  collaboration with non-State actors, as appropriate, in activities that fall  within the General Programme of Work, including:  • product development  • capacity-building  • operational collaboration in emergencies  • contributing to the implementation of WHO’s policies.  MANAGEMENT OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND OTHER  RISKS OF ENGAGEMENT    . Managing, including by, where appropriate, avoiding, conflict of  interest and other risks of engagement requires a series of steps, as set out  below:   • WHO needs to know the non-State actors that it engages with.  Therefore each non-State actor is required to provide all relevant   information about itself and its activities, following which WHO  conducts the necessary due diligence.  _________    The framework is designed to regulate institutional engagements; its implementation is closely  coordinated with the implementation of other organizational policies regulating conflict of interest in respect  of individuals (see paragraph   ).    As defined in paragraph   .                 BASIC DOCUMENTS  • WHO conducts a risk assessment in order to identify the specific risks of engagement associated with each engagement with a non-State actor. • Risks of engagement need to be managed and communicated coherently in each of the three levels of the Organization and throughout the Organization. To that end, WHO manages engagement through a single, Organization-wide electronic tool.  • Member States exercise oversight over WHO’s engagement with non- State actors in accordance with the provisions in paragraphs    and   . Conflict of interest    . A conflict of interest arises in circumstances where there is potential for a secondary interest (a vested interest in the outcome of WHO’s work in a given area) to unduly influence, or where it may be reasonably perceived to unduly influence, either the independence or objectivity of professional judgement or actions regarding a primary interest (WHO’s work) The existence of conflict of interest in all its forms does not as such mean that improper action has occurred, but rather the risk of such improper action occurring. Conflicts of interest are not only financial, but can take other forms as well.   .Individual conflicts of interests within WHO are those involving experts, regardless of their status, and staff members; these are addressed in accordance with the policies listed under paragraph    of the present framework.   . All institutions have multiple interests, which means that in engaging with non-State actors WHO is often faced with a combination of converging and conflicting interests. An institutional conflict of interest is a situation where WHO’s primary interest as reflected in its Constitution may be unduly influenced by the conflicting interest of a non-State actor in a way that affects, or may reasonably be perceived to affect, the independence and objectivity of WHO’s work.   . In actively managing institutional conflict of interest and the other risks of engagement mentioned in paragraph   above, WHO aims to avoid allowing the conflicting interests of a non-State actor to exert, or be _________    WHO uses an electronic tool for managing engagement. As described in footnote   of paragraph   ,  the publicly visible part of the tool is the register of non-State actors; the tool also provides an electronic  workflow for the internal management of engagement. A similar electronic tool is used for the management  of individual conflicts of interest, in order to harmonize the implementation of the framework with the  implementation of the policy on management of individual conflicts of interest for experts.  FRAMEWORK OF ENGAGEMENT WITH NON-STATE ACTORS       reasonably perceived to exert, undue influence over the Organization’s  decision-making process or to prevail over its interests.    . For WHO, the potential risk of institutional conflicts of interest could be  the highest in situations where the interest of non-State actors, in particular  economic, commercial or financial, are in conflict with WHO’s public  health policies, constitutional mandate and interests, in particular the  Organization’s independence and impartiality in setting policies, norms and  standards.  Due diligence and risk assessment    . When the possibility of entering into an engagement is being considered,  the relevant technical unit in the Secretariat conducts an initial examination  in order to establish whether such an engagement would be in the interest  of the Organization and in line with the principles of WHO’s engagement  with non-State actors in paragraph   and the priorities defined in the General  Programme of Work and Programme budget. If this seems to be the case,  the technical unit consults the WHO Register on non-State actors and as  needed asks the non-State actor to provide its basic information. Using the  Organization-wide electronic tool, the unit then complements this  information with a description of the proposed engagement and its own  assessment of the benefits and risks involved, as needed.    . The technical unit makes an initial assessment. If the engagement is of  low risk, for example because of its repetitive nature  or because it does not  involve policies, norms and standard setting, a simplified due diligence and  risk assessment modulating the procedures in paragraphs   –   as well as     can be performed by the technical unit and the risk management decision  taken, taking such steps as are necessary to ensure full compliance with  paragraphs  – .  For all other engagements full procedures apply.    . Before engaging with any non-State actor, WHO, in order to preserve  its integrity, conducts due diligence and risk assessment. Due diligence  refers to the steps taken by WHO to find and verify relevant information on  a non-State actor and to reach a clear understanding of its profile. While due  diligence refers to the nature of the non-State actor concerned, risk  assessment refers to the assessment of a specific proposed engagement with  that non-State actor.  _________    Provided that due diligence and risk assessment have already been carried out and the nature of  engagement has remained unchanged.    The simplified due diligence and risk assessment, and information to be provided by non-State actors  as well as the criteria of low risk engagements are described in the guide for staff.                 BASIC DOCUMENTS    . Due diligence combines a review of the information provided by the  non-State actor, a search for information about the entity concerned from  other sources, and an analysis of all the information obtained. This includes  a screening of different public, legal and commercial sources of information,  including: media; the entity’s website companies’ analyst reports,  directories and profiles; and public, legal and governmental sources.    . The core functions of due diligence are to:  • clarify the nature and purpose of the entity proposed to engage with  WHO;  • clarify the interest and objectives of the entity in engaging with WHO  and what it expects in return;  • determine the entity’s legal status, area of activities, membership,  governance, sources of funding, constitution, statutes, and by-laws  and affiliation;  • define the main elements of the history and activities of the entity in  terms of  issues;  environmental, ethical and business issues; reputation and image; and  financial stability;  the following: health, human and  labour  • identify if paragraph    or    should be applied.    . Due diligence also allows the Secretariat for the purpose of its  engagement to categorize each non-State actor in relation to one of the four  groups of non-State actors on the basis of its nature, objectives, governance,  funding, independence and membership. This categorization is indicated in  the register of non-State actors.    . Risks are the expression of the likelihood and potential impact of an  event that would affect the Organization’s ability to achieve its objectives.  A risk assessment on a proposed engagement is conducted in addition to  due diligence. This involves the assessment of risks associated with an  engagement with a non-State actor, in particular the risks described in  paragraph   and is to be conducted without prejudice to the type of non-State  actor.  Risk management    . Risk management concerns the process leading to a management  decision whereby the Secretariat decides explicitly and justifiably on entry  into engagement,  continuation of engagement, engagement with measures  _________    Other than decisions related to official relations as set out in paragraphs   –  .            FRAMEWORK OF ENGAGEMENT WITH NON-STATE ACTORS       to mitigate risks, non-engagement or disengagement from an existing or  planned engagement with non-State actors. It is a management decision  usually taken by the unit engaging with the non-State actor based on a  recommendation of the specialized unit responsible for performing due  diligence and risk assessment.    . A dedicated secretariat mechanism reviews proposals of engagement  referred to it and recommends engagement, continuation of engagement,  engagement with measures  to mitigate risks, non-engagement or  disengagement from an existing or planned engagement with non-State  actors. The Director-General, working with the Regional Directors, ensures  coherence and consistency in implementation and interpretation of this  Framework across all levels of the Organization.    . WHO takes a risk-management approach to engagement, only entering  into an engagement with a non-State actor when the benefits in terms of  direct or indirect contributions to public health and the fulfilment of the  Organization’s mandate as mentioned in paragraph   outweigh any residual  risks of engagement as mentioned in paragraph  , as well as the time and  expense involved in establishing and maintaining the engagement.  Transparency    . WHO’s interaction with non-State actors is managed transparently.  WHO provides an annual report to the governing bodies on its engagement  with non-State actors, including summary information on due diligence, risk  assessment and risk management undertaken by the Secretariat. WHO also  makes publicly available appropriate information on its engagement with  non-State actors.    . The WHO register of non-State actors is an Internet-based, publicly  available electronic tool used by the Secretariat   to document and  coordinate engagement with non-State actors. It contains the main standard  information provided by non-State actors  and high-level descriptions of  the engagement that WHO has with these actors.     . Non-State actors engaging with WHO are required to provide  information on their organization. This information includes: name,  membership, legal status, objective, governance structure, composition of  _________    The register of non-State actors is the first level of a tool used by the Secretariat containing four levels  of information: a publicly available level, a level made available to Member States, a working level for the  Secretariat, and a level of confidential and sensitive information accessible to a limited number of individuals  within the Secretariat.    Information on financial contributions received from non-State actors is documented in this register  and in the Programme Budget web portal.    The register covers all three levels of the Organization – global, regional and country – and includes  hosted partnerships and joint programmes.                 BASIC DOCUMENTS  main decision-making bodies, assets, annual income and funding sources,  main relevant affiliations, webpage and one or more focal points for WHO  contacts.    . When the Secretariat decides on an engagement with a non-State actor,  a summary of the information submitted by that entity and held in the WHO  register of non-State actors is made public. The accuracy of the information  provided by the non-State actor and published in the register is the  responsibility of the non-State actor concerned and does not constitute any  form of endorsement by WHO.    . Non-State actors described in the register must update the information  provided on themselves annually or upon the request of WHO. Information  in the WHO register of non-State actors will be dated. Information on  entities that are no longer engaged with WHO or that have not updated their  information will be marked as “archived”. Archived information from the  WHO register of non-State actors can be considered in relation to future  applications for engagement, where relevant.    . In addition to the publicly available information, Member States have  electronic access to a summary report on due diligence of each non-State  actor and their respective risk assessment and risk management on  engagement. Member States also have access, on demand, to the associated  full report through a remote secure access platform.    . WHO maintains a handbook to guide non-State actors in their  interaction with WHO in line with this framework. A guide for staff is also  maintained on the implementation of the Framework of Engagement with  Non-State Actors.  SPECIFIC PROVISIONS    . WHO does not engage with the tobacco industry or non-State actors that  work to further the interests of the tobacco industry. WHO also does not  engage with the arms industry.  Engagement where particular caution should be exercised    . WHO will exercise particular caution, especially while conducting due  diligence, risk assessment and risk management, when engaging with  private sector entities and other non-State actors whose policies or activities  are negatively affecting human health and are not in line with WHO’s  policies, norms and  to  noncommunicable diseases and their determinants.  in particular  standards,  related  those            FRAMEWORK OF ENGAGEMENT WITH NON-STATE ACTORS       Association with WHO’s name and emblem    . WHO’s name and emblem are recognized by the public as symbols of  integrity and quality assurance. WHO’s name, acronym and emblem shall  not, therefore, be used for, or in conjunction with, commercial, promotional  marketing and advertisement purposes. Any use of the name or emblem  needs an explicit written authorization by the Director-General of WHO.   Secondments    . WHO does not accept secondments from private sector entities.  RELATION OF THE FRAMEWORK TO WHO’S OTHER  POLICIES    . This framework replaces the Principles governing relations between the  World Health Organization and nongovernmental organizations  and the  Guidelines on interaction with commercial enterprises to achieve health  outcomes (noted by the Executive Board).     . The implementation of the policies listed below as they relate to WHO’s  engagement with non-State actors will be coordinated and aligned with the  Framework of Engagement with Non-State Actors. In the event that a  conflict is identified, it will be brought to the attention of the Executive  Board through its Programme, Budget and Administration Committee.  (a) Policy on WHO’s engagement with global health partnerships and  hosting arrangements.   (i) Hosted partnerships derive their legal personality from WHO and  are subject to the Organization’s rules and regulations. Therefore the  Framework of Engagement with Non-State Actors applies to their  engagement with non-State actors. They have a formal governance  structure, separate from that of the WHO governing bodies, in which  decisions are taken on direction, workplans and budgets; and their  programmatic accountability frameworks are also independent from  those of the Organization. In the same way the framework applies to  other hosted entities which are subject to the Organizations Rules  and Regulations.  (ii) WHO’s involvement in external partnerships is regulated by the  policy on WHO’s engagement with global health partnerships and  _________    See http://www.who.int/about/licensing/emblem/en/.

Endorsed by the Health Assembly in resolution WHA  .   (    ) on partnerships and its Annex  .                 BASIC DOCUMENTS  hosting arrangements. The Framework of Engagement with Non- State Actors also applies  these  partnerships.   to WHO’s engagement  in  (b) Regulations for Expert Advisory Panels and Committees and the  Guidelines for Declaration of Interests (WHO Experts). The  management of WHO’s relations with individual experts is regulated by  the Regulations for Expert Advisory Panels and Committees  and the  Guidelines for Declaration of Interests (WHO Experts).  (c) Staff Regulations and Staff Rules. All staff are subject to the  Organization’s Staff Regulations and Staff Rules, noting in particular  the provisions of declaration of interest therein: according to Article  .   of the Staff Regulations of the World Health Organization, all staff  members “pledge themselves to discharge their functions and to regulate  their conduct with the interests of the World Health Organization only  in view.”  (d) Regulations for Study and Scientific Groups, Collaborating  Institutions and other Mechanisms of Collaboration. Scientific  collaborations are regulated by the Regulations for Study and Scientific  Groups, Collaborating  Institutions and other Mechanisms of  Collaboration.   (e) Financial Regulations and Financial Rules.  (i) The procurement of goods and services is regulated by the  Financial Regulations and Financial Rules;  it is not covered by the  Framework of Engagement with Non-State Actors, although pro- bono contributions from non-State actors are covered.  (ii) Like any other financing of WHO, financing from non-State  actors is regulated by the Financial Regulations and Financial Rules  and the decision on accepting such financial contributions is also  regulated by this framework.  _________    The Codex Alimentarius Commission is an intergovernmental body which is the principal organ of  the joint FAO/WHO food standards programme for which the administration is not solely provided by WHO.  The Commission is supported by subsidiary bodies including Codex committees, regional coordinating  committees and task forces. Meetings of the Commission, Committees, including independent expert  committees, and Task Forces are regulated by the Rules of Procedure and other decisions adopted by the  Codex Alimentarius Commission.

The aims  and activities of all these entities shall be in conformity with the spirit,  purposes and principles of WHO’s Constitution, and they shall contribute  significantly to the advancement of public health. Organizations in official  relations can attend governing body meetings of WHO but are otherwise  subject to the same rules as other non-State actors when engaging with  WHO.    . Entities in official relations are international in membership and/or  scope. All entities in official relations shall have a constitution or similar  basic document, an established headquarters, a governing body, an  administrative structure, and a regularly updated entry in the WHO register  of non-State actors.    . Official relations shall be based on a plan for collaboration between  WHO and the entity with agreed objectives and outlining activities for the  coming three-year period structured in accordance with the General  Programme of Work and Programme budget and consistent with this  framework. This plan shall also be published in the WHO register of  non-State actors. These organizations shall provide annually a short report  on the progress made in implementing the plan of collaboration and other  related activities which will also be published in the WHO register. These  plans shall be free from concerns which are primarily of a commercial or  profit-making nature.    . For nongovernmental organizations working on global health issues,  sustained and systematic engagement could include research and active  advocacy around WHO meetings and WHO’s policies, norms and standards.  Official  for such nongovernmental  organizations based on at least three years of their activities and future work  plan on research and advocacy on global public health issues.  relations may be considered    . The Executive Board shall be responsible for deciding on the admission  of organizations into official relations with WHO and shall review this  status every three years. The Director-General may propose international  nongovernmental  and  international business associations for admission. The Director-General can  organizations,  philanthropic  foundations  _________    At least two years of systematic engagement as documented in the WHO register of non-State actors,  assessed by both parties to be mutually beneficial. Participation in each other’s meetings alone is not  considered to be a systematic engagement.                 BASIC DOCUMENTS  also propose an earlier review based on the experience in the collaboration  with the organization concerned.    . Entities in official relations are invited to participate in sessions of  WHO’s governing bodies. This privilege shall include:  (a) the possibility to appoint a representative to participate, without right  of vote, in meetings of WHO’s governing bodies or in meetings of the  committees and conferences convened under its authority;  (b) the possibility to make a statement if the Chairman of the meeting (i)  invites them to do so or (ii) accedes to their request when an item in  which the related entity is particularly interested is being discussed;  (c) the possibility to submit the statement referred to in subparagraph (b)  above in advance of the debate for the Secretariat to post on a dedicated  website.    . Non-State actors participating in WHO governing bodies’ meetings  shall designate a head of their delegation and declare the affiliations of their  delegates. This declaration shall include the function of each delegate within  the non-State actor itself and, where applicable, the function of that delegate  within any affiliated organization.    . Regional committees may also decide on a procedure granting  accreditation to their meetings to other international, regional, and national   non-State actors not in official relations with WHO as long as the procedure  is managed in accordance with this framework.  Procedure for admitting and reviewing organizations in official  relations    . The application for admission into official relations shall be based on  the up-to-date entries in the WHO register of non-State actors, providing all  the necessary information as requested on the non-State actor’s nature and  activities. The application shall include a summary of past engagement as  documented in the register of non-State actors and a three-year plan for  collaboration with WHO that has been developed and agreed on jointly by  the non-State actor and WHO.    . A signed letter certifying the accuracy of the application for official  relations submitted online shall reach WHO headquarters no later than the  end of the month of July for submission to the Executive Board at its session  the following January. Applications for official relations shall be reviewed  to ensure that the established criteria and other requirements are fulfilled as  _________    In accordance with the Constitution of the World Health Organization, Article   .            FRAMEWORK OF ENGAGEMENT WITH NON-STATE ACTORS       set out in this framework. Applications should be transmitted to the  Executive Board members by the Secretariat six weeks before the opening  of the January session of the Executive Board at which they will be  considered.    . During the Board’s January session, the Programme, Budget and  Administration Committee of  the Executive Board shall consider  applications submitted and shall make recommendations to the Board. A  representative of an applicant organization may be invited by the Committee  to speak before it in connection with that organization’s application. Should  the applicant organization be considered not to meet the established criteria,  and bearing in mind the desirability of ensuring a valuable continuing  partnership based on defined objectives and evidenced by a record of  successful past engagement and a framework for future collaborative  activities, the Committee may recommend postponement of consideration  or rejection of an application.    . The Board, after considering the recommendations of the Committee,  shall decide whether an organization is to be admitted into official relations  with WHO. A reapplication from a non-State actor shall not normally be  considered until two years have elapsed since the Board’s decision on the  previous application.    . The Director-General shall inform each organization of the Board’s  decision on its application. The Director-General shall document decisions  taken within the Secretariat and by the Executive Board on applications  from non-State actors, reflect this status in the WHO register of non-State  actors, and maintain a list of the organizations admitted into official  relations.    . The entities in official relations and the Secretariat should name focal  points for collaboration who are responsible for informing each other and  their organizations of any developments in the implementation of the plan  for collaboration and who are the first points of contact for any changes or  problems.    . The Board, through its Programme, Budget and Administration  Committee, shall review collaboration with each non-State actor in official  relations every three years and shall decide on the desirability of  maintaining official relations or defer the decision on the review to the  following year. The Board’s review shall be spread over a three-year period,  one third of the entities in official relations being reviewed each year.    . The Director-General can propose earlier reviews of a non-State actor’s  official relations with WHO by the Executive Board through its Programme,  Budget and Administration Committee in case of issues such as                 BASIC DOCUMENTS  non-fulfilment of the entity’s part in the plan of collaboration, lack of  contact, failure by the non-State actor to fulfil its reporting requirements or  changes in the nature or activities of the organization concerned, the  non-State actor ceasing to fulfil the criteria for admission, or any potential  new risks for the collaboration.    . The Board may discontinue official relations if it considers that such  relations are no longer appropriate or necessary in the light of changing  programmes or other circumstances. Similarly, the Board may suspend or  discontinue official relations if an organization no longer meets the criteria  that applied at the time of the establishment of such relations, fails to update  its information and report on the collaboration in the WHO register on  non-State actors or fails to fulfil its part in the agreed programme of  collaboration.  OVERSIGHT OF ENGAGEMENT  through    . The Executive Board,  its Programme, Budget and  Administration Committee, oversees the implementation of WHO’s  Framework of Engagement with Non-State Actors, proposes revisions to  the framework and can grant the privileges of official relations to  international nongovernmental organizations, philanthropic foundations  and international business associations.    . The Programme Budget and Administration Committee of the Executive  Board shall review, provide guidance and, as appropriate, make  recommendations to the Executive Board on:  (a) oversight of WHO’s  Engagement with Non-State Actors including:  implementation of  the Framework of  (i) consideration of the annual report on engagement with non-State  actors submitted by the Director-General  (ii) any other matter on engagement referred to the Committee by the  Board  (b) entities in official relations with WHO, including:  (i) proposals for admitting non-State actors into official relations  (ii) review of renewals of entities in official relations  (c) any proposal, when needed, for revisions of the Framework of  Engagement with Non-State Actors.            FRAMEWORK OF ENGAGEMENT WITH NON-STATE ACTORS       NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THIS FRAMEWORK    . Non-compliance can include inter alia the following: significant delays  in the provision of information to the WHO register of non-State actors;  provision of wrong information; use of the engagement with WHO for  purposes other than protecting and promoting public health, such as for  commercial, promotional, marketing and advertisement purposes; misuse of  WHO’s name and emblem; attempt at undue influence; and abuse of the  privileges conferred by official relations.    . Non-compliance by a non-State actor with the provisions of this  framework can have consequences for the entity concerned after due  process including a reminder, a warning, a cease-and-desist letter, a  rejection of renewal of engagement and termination of engagement. The  review of the status of official relations by the Executive Board can be  anticipated and non-compliance can be the reason for non-renewal of  official relations. Except in the case of important and intentional cases of  non-compliance the non-State actor concerned should not be automatically  excluded from other engagements with WHO.    . Any financial contribution received by WHO that is subsequently  discovered to be non-compliant with the terms of this framework shall be  returned to the contributor.  IMPLEMENTATION    . Consistent with the principles identified in paragraph  , this framework  will be implemented in its entirety in a manner that manages and strengthens  WHO’s engagement with non-State actors towards the attainment of public  health objectives, including through multistakeholder partnerships, whilst  protecting and preserving WHO’s integrity, independence, credibility and  reputation;    . The Director-General, in the application of this framework, when  responding to acute public health events described in the International  Health Regulations (    ) or other emergencies with health consequences,  will act according to the WHO Constitution  and the principles identified  in this framework. In doing so, the Director-General may exercise flexibility  as might be needed in the application of the procedures of this framework  in those responses, when he/she deems necessary, in accordance with  WHO’s responsibilities as health cluster lead, and the need to engage  quickly and broadly with non-State actors for coordination, scale up and  _________    Including Article  (d) of the Constitution of the World Health Organization.                 BASIC DOCUMENTS  service delivery . The Director-General will inform Member States through  appropriate means,   including in particular written communication,  without undue delay when such a response requires exercise of flexibility,  and include summary information with justification on the use of such  flexibility in the annual report on engagement with non-State actors.  MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF THE FRAMEWORK    . The implementation of the framework will be constantly monitored  internally and by the Executive Board through its Programme, Budget and  Administration Committee in the annual report on engagement with  non-State actors and the assessment of information available in the register  of non-State actors.  the  implementation of  the framework should be    . Furthermore,  periodically evaluated. The results of such evaluation, together with any  proposals for revisions of the framework, shall also be submitted to the  Executive Board through its Programme, Budget and Administration  Committee.  WHO POLICY AND OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES ON  ENGAGEMENT WITH  NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS  regulates   .

Technical collaboration with nongovernmental organizations is encouraged.  This collaboration must be in the interest of WHO, and managed in  accordance with the overarching framework and this policy to protect WHO,  and in particular, its normative work, from any undue influence or conflict  of interest and to ensure there is no interference with WHO’s advisory  function to Member States.  WHO POLICY AND OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES ON  ENGAGEMENT WITH PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITIES   . This policy regulates specifically WHO’s engagement with private  sector entities by type of interaction.  The provisions of the overarching  framework also apply to all engagements with private sector entities.   . When engaging with private sector entities, it should be borne in mind  that WHO’s activities affect the commercial sector in broader ways, through,  among others, its public health guidance, its recommendations on normative  standards, or other work that might indirectly or directly influence product  costs, market demand, or profitability of specific goods and services.   . In engaging with private sector entities, WHO will aim to operate on a  competitively neutral basis.  PARTICIPATION  Participation by private sector entities in WHO meetings    . WHO can invite private sector entities to participate in consultations,  hearings or other meetings in accordance with paragraph    of the  overarching framework. Consultations and hearings can be electronic or in  person.   . Participation in other meetings is on the basis of discussion of an item  in which the private sector entity has a particular interest and where its  participation adds value to the deliberations of the meeting. Such  _________    See paragraphs   –   of the overarching framework for the five types of interaction.    Other than sessions of the governing bodies, which are regulated by the policy on management of  engagement.            FRAMEWORK OF ENGAGEMENT WITH NON-STATE ACTORS       participation is for the exchange of information and views, but never for the  formulation of advice.   . The nature of participation of private sector entities depends on the type  of meeting concerned. The format, modalities, and the participation of  private sector entities in consultations, hearings, and other meetings is  decided on a case-by-case basis by the WHO governing bodies or by the  Secretariat. Participation and inputs received from private sector entities  shall be made publicly available, wherever possible. Private sector entities  do not take part in any decision making process of the Organization.  Involvement of the Secretariat in meetings organized by private sector  entities   . WHO staff members may participate in meetings organized by a private  sector entity as long as the integrity, independence and reputation of the  Organization are preserved and as long as this participation furthers WHO’s  objectives as expressed in the General Programme of Work. The private  sector entity shall not misrepresent WHO’s participation as official WHO  support for, or endorsement of, the meeting, and shall agree not to use  WHO’s participation for commercial and/or promotional purposes.  Specific policies and operational procedures   . The participation of WHO staff members in meetings of private sector  entities as panellists, speakers or in any other capacity shall be managed  according to the provisions of the overarching framework and this specific  policy.   . WHO does not cosponsor meetings organized wholly or partly by  private sector entities. It may, however, cosponsor a meeting for which the  scientific initiators have hired a commercial conference organizer to deal  with the logistical aspects, provided that the commercial organizer makes  no contribution to the scientific content of the meeting.    . WHO does not cosponsor meetings organized by other actors where one  or more health-related private sector entities are also cosponsors. Other  instances of cosponsorship of meetings organized by other actors where  non-health-related private sector entities are also cosponsors should be  reviewed on a case-by-case basis and are subject to the provisions of this  framework.    . There shall be no commercial exhibitions on WHO premises and at  WHO’s meetings.                 BASIC DOCUMENTS    . WHO does not cosponsor commercial exhibitions, whether as part of  meetings organized by private sector entities or as part of meetings  organized by other actors.  RESOURCES    . The level of risk associated with the acceptance of resources from  private sector entities depends on the field of activity of the private sector  entity, the WHO activity for which the resources are used and the modalities  of the contributions.  (a) Financial contributions may be accepted from private sector entities  whose business is unrelated to that of WHO, provided they are not  engaged in any activity or have close ties with any entity that is  incompatible with WHO’s mandate and work.  (b) Financial contributions may not be sought or accepted from private  sector entities that have, themselves or through their affiliated  companies, a direct commercial interest in the outcome of the project  toward which they would be contributing, unless approved in  conformity with the provisions for clinical trials or product development  (see paragraph    below).  (c) The provisions set out in paragraph   (b) shall be without prejudice  to specific mechanisms, such as the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness  Framework (“PIP Framework”), set up by the Health Assembly that  involve the receipt and pooling of resources.   (d) Caution should be exercised in accepting financial contributions  from private sector entities that have even an indirect interest in the  outcome of the project (i.e. the activity is related to the entities’ field of  interest, without there being a conflict as referred to above). In such an  event, other commercial enterprises having a similar indirect interest  should be invited to contribute, and the reason clearly described if this  does not prove possible. The larger the proportion of the contribution  from any one source, the greater the care that should be taken to avoid  the possibility of a conflict of interest or appearance of an inappropriate  association with one contributor.    . Financial and in-kind contributions from private sector entities to  WHO’s programmes are only acceptable in the following conditions:  (a) the contribution is not used for normative work;  _________    In accordance with paragraph    of the overarching framework.            FRAMEWORK OF ENGAGEMENT WITH NON-STATE ACTORS       (b) if a contribution is used for activities other than normative work in  which the private sector entity could have a commercial interest, the  public health benefit of the engagement needs clearly to outweigh its  potential risks;  (c) the proportion of funding of any activity coming from the private  sector cannot be such that the programme’s continuation would become  dependent on this support;  (d) the acceptance of  the contribution does not constitute an  endorsement by WHO of the private sector entity, or its activities,  products or services;  (e) the contributor may not use the results of WHO’s work for  commercial purposes or use the fact of its contribution in its promotional  material;  (f) the acceptance of the contribution does not afford the contributor any  privilege or advantage;  (g) the acceptance of the contribution does not offer the contributor any  possibility for advising, influencing, participating in, or being in  command of the management or implementation of operational  activities;  (h) WHO keeps its discretionary right to decline a contribution, without  any further explanation.    . Any acceptance of resources from private sector entities is handled in  accordance with the provisions of this framework and relevant other WHO  rules and guidelines such as the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules, the  Financial Regulations and Financial Rules and policies governing  procurement, as well as WHO’s guidelines for medicine donations and  WHO’s guidelines for health care equipment donations;    . For reasons of transparency, contributions from private sector entities  must be publicly acknowledged by WHO in accordance with its policies and  practices.    . Acknowledgements shall usually be worded along the following lines:  “The World Health Organization gratefully acknowledges the financial  contribution of [Private sector entity] towards [description of the outcome  or activity]”.    . Contributions received from private sector entities, are listed in the  financial report and audited financial statements of WHO as well as the  Programme budget web portal and the register of non-State actors.                 BASIC DOCUMENTS    . Private sector entities may not use the fact that they have made a  contribution in their materials used for commercial, promotional, marketing  and advertisement purposes.  However, they may make reference to the  contribution in their annual reports or similar documents. In addition, they  in special  may mention  non-promotional publications, provided that the content and context have  been agreed with WHO.  the contribution on  their websites, and  Donations of medicines and other health technologies     . In determining the acceptability of large-scale donations of medicines  and other health-related products, the following criteria should be met.  (a) Sound evidence exists of the safety and efficacy of the product in the  indication for which it is being donated. The product is approved or  otherwise authorized by the recipient country for use in that indication;  it should also preferably appear in the WHO Model List of Essential  Medicines for that indication.  (b) Objective and justifiable criteria for the selection of recipient  countries, communities or patients have been determined. In emergency  situations, flexibilities may be required.  (c) A supply system is in place and consideration is given to means of  preventing waste, theft and misuse (including leakage back into the  market).  (d) A training and supervision programme is in place for all personnel  involved in the efficient administration of supply, storage and  distribution at every point from the donor to the end-user.  (e) A donation of medicines and other health-related products is not of  a promotional nature, either with regard to the company itself or insofar  as it creates a demand for the products that is not sustainable once the  donation has ended.  (f) WHO does not accept products at the end of their shelf life.  (g) A phase-out plan for the donation has been agreed upon with  recipient countries.  _________    In accordance with paragraph    of the overarching framework.    Such donations shall be in line with interagency guidelines: World Health Organization, Ecumenical  Pharmaceutical Network, International Pharmaceutical Federation, International Federation of Red Cross  and Red Crescent Societies, International Health Partners, The Partnership for Quality Medical Donations,  et al. Guidelines for medicine donations – revised     . Geneva: World Health Organization;     .            FRAMEWORK OF ENGAGEMENT WITH NON-STATE ACTORS       (h) A system for monitoring adverse reactions to the product has been  set up with the participation of the donating company.    . In consultation with the department responsible for financial matters in  WHO, the value of donations of medicines and other health-related products  is determined and is formally recorded in the audited statements and the  WHO register of non-State actors.  Financial contributions for clinical trials    . Except as provided in paragraph    below on product development,  financial contributions from a private sector entity for a clinical trial  arranged by WHO on that company’s proprietary product are considered on  a case-by-case basis. In this connection, it should be ensured that:  (a) the research or development activity is of public health importance;  (b) the research is conducted at WHO’s request and potential conflicts  of interest are managed;  (c) WHO only accepts such financial contributions, if the research  would not take place without WHO’s involvement or if WHO’s  involvement is necessary in order to ensure that the research is  undertaken in conformity with internationally accepted technical and  ethical standards and guidelines.    . If the above-mentioned requirements are met, a financial contribution  may be accepted from a company having a direct commercial interest in the  trial in question, provided that appropriate mechanisms are put in place to  ensure that WHO controls the conduct and the dissemination of the  outcomes of the trials, including the content of any resulting publication,  and that the trial results are free from any inappropriate influence or  perceived influence from the company concerned.  Contributions for WHO meetings    . For meetings convened by WHO, a contribution from a private sector  entity may not be accepted if it is designated to support the participation of  specific invitees (including such invitees’ travel and accommodation),  regardless of whether such contribution would be provided directly to the  participants or channelled through WHO.    . Contributions may be accepted to support the overall costs of a meeting.    . WHO receptions and similar functions shall not be paid for by private  sector entities.                 BASIC DOCUMENTS  Contributions for WHO staff participating in external meetings    . An external meeting is one convened by a party other than WHO.  Support from private sector entities for travel of WHO staff members to  attend external meetings or conferences may fall into two categories:  (a) meetings held by the private sector entity paying for travel: financing  for travel may be accepted in accordance with WHO’s rules if the private  sector entity is also supporting the travel and ancillary expenses of other  participants in the meeting, and the risk of a conflict of interest has been  assessed and managed;  (b) meetings held by a third party (i.e. a party other than the private  sector entity proposing to pay for the travel): financing for travel may  not be accepted from a private sector entity.  Contributions for publications    . Financial contributions may be accepted from private sector entities for  meeting the printing costs of WHO publications, as long as no conflict of  interest arises. In no event may commercial advertisements be placed in  WHO publications;  Cost recovery    . In cases where a WHO evaluation scheme is in place (i.e. to evaluate  certain products, processes or services against official WHO guidelines),  the Organization may charge private sector entities for such services on the  basis of cost recovery. The purpose of WHO’s evaluation schemes is always  to provide advice to governments and/or international organizations for  procurement. Evaluation does not constitute endorsement by WHO of the  product(s), process or service in question.  EVIDENCE    . Private sector entities may provide their up-to-date information and  knowledge on technical issues, and share their experience with WHO, as  appropriate, subject to the provisions of the overarching framework, and  this specific policy and operational procedures, and other applicable WHO  rules, policies and procedures. Such contribution should be made publicly  available, as appropriate, wherever possible. Scientific evidence generated  should be made publicly available.            FRAMEWORK OF ENGAGEMENT WITH NON-STATE ACTORS       ADVOCACY    .

Specific policies and operational procedures    . If WHO has drawn up official specifications for a product, it may  provide technical advice to manufacturers for development of their product  in accordance with these specifications, provided that all private sector  entities known to have an interest in such a product are given the  opportunity to collaborate with WHO in the same way.    . WHO may collaborate with private sector entities in the research and  development of health-related technologies that contribute to increasing  access to quality, safe, efficacious and affordable medical products.  Collaborative research and development should, as a general rule, be  undertaken only if WHO and the private sector entity have concluded an  agreement which ensures that the final product will ultimately be widely  available, including to the public sector of developing countries at a  _________    Private sector entities working with WHO will be expected to conform to WHO’s public health  policies in areas such as food safety, chemical safety, ethical promotion of medicinal drug products, tobacco  control, noncommunicable diseases, as well as health and safety at work.                 BASIC DOCUMENTS  preferential price.

This policy regulates specifically WHO’s engagement with academic  institutions by type of interaction.   The provisions of the overarching  framework also apply to all engagements with academic institutions.   . The engagement with academic institutions at the institutional level has  to be distinguished from the collaboration with individual experts working  for academic institutions.  PARTICIPATION  Participation by academic institutions in WHO meetings   . WHO can invite academic institutions to participate in consultations,  hearings or other meetings in accordance with paragraph    of the  overarching framework. Consultations and hearings can be electronic or in  person.   . Participation in other meetings is on the basis of discussion of an item  in which the academic institution has a particular interest and where its  participation adds value to the deliberations of the meeting. Such  participation is for the exchange of information and views, but never for the  formulation of advice.   . The nature of participation of academic institution depends on the type  of meeting concerned. The format, modalities, and the participation of  academic institution in consultations, hearings, and other meetings is  decided on a case-by-case basis by the WHO governing bodies or by the  Secretariat. Participation and inputs received from academic institutions  shall be made publicly available, wherever possible. Academic institutions  do not take part in any decision-making process of the Organization.  Involvement of the Secretariat in meetings organized by academic  institutions   . WHO can organize joint meetings, or cosponsor meetings organized by  academic institutions, as long as the integrity, independence and reputation  of the Organization are preserved, and as long as this participation furthers  WHO’s objectives as expressed in the General Programme of Work. WHO  staff members may participate in meetings organized by academic  institutions in accordance with the Organization’s internal rules.

This can be either for a project of the institution which WHO  considers merits support, based on a clear public health interest, and is  consistent with WHO’s General Programme of Work, or for a project  organized or coordinated by WHO. The former constitutes a grant, the latter  a service.  Specific policies and operational procedures    . Any acceptance of resources from an academic institution is handled in  accordance with the provisions of this framework and relevant other WHO  rules and guidelines such as the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules, the  Financial Regulations and Financial Rules and policies governing  procurement, as well as WHO’s guidelines for medicine donations and  WHO’s guidelines for health care equipment donations;    .

However, they may make reference to the  contribution in their annual reports or similar documents. In addition, they  may mention  in special  non-promotional publications, provided that the content and context have  been agreed with WHO.  the contribution on  their websites, and  EVIDENCE    .

In no case shall the External Auditor(s) include criticism in any report without first affording the   .  Director-General an adequate opportunity of explanation on the matter under observation.    . The External Auditor(s) is/are not required to mention any matter referred to in the foregoing  which is considered immaterial.  ––––––––––            STAFF REGULATIONS OF THE WORLD HEALTH  ORGANIZATION   SCOPE AND PURPOSE  The Staff Regulations embody the fundamental conditions of service  and the basic rights, duties and obligations of the World Health  Organization Secretariat staff. They are the broad principles of personnel  policy for the guidance of the Director-General in the staffing and  administration of the Secretariat. The Director-General may, as Chief  Administrative Officer, provide and enforce such Staff Rules consistent  with these principles as he considers necessary.  I. DUTIES, OBLIGATIONS AND PRIVILEGES   .  All staff members of the Organization are international civil servants.  Their responsibilities are not national but exclusively international. By  accepting appointment, they pledge themselves to discharge their functions  and to regulate their conduct with the interests of the World Health  Organization only in view.   .  All staff members are subject to the authority of the Director-General  and to assignment by him to any of the activities or offices of the World  Health Organization. They are responsible to him in the exercise of their  functions. In principle, the whole time of staff members shall be at the  disposal of the Director-General.   .  In the performance of their duties staff members shall neither seek nor  accept instructions from any government or from any other authority  external to the Organization.   .  No staff member shall accept, hold or engage in any office or  occupation which is incompatible with the proper discharge of his duties  with the World Health Organization.   .  Staff members shall conduct themselves at all times in a manner  compatible with their status as international civil servants. They shall avoid  any action and in particular any kind of public pronouncement which may  adversely reflect on their status. While they are not expected to give up their  national sentiments or their political and religious convictions, they shall at  _________    Text adopted by the Fourth World Health Assembly (resolution WHA .  ) and amended by the  Twelfth, Fifty-fifth, Sixty-second, Sixty-eighth, Sixty-ninth and Seventy-first World Health Assemblies  (resolutions WHA  .  , WHA  .  , WHA  . , WHA  .  , WHA  .   and WHA  .  , respectively).  –     –           BASIC DOCUMENTS  all times bear in mind the reserve and tact incumbent upon them by reason  of their international status.   .  Staff members shall exercise the utmost discretion in regard to all  matters of official business. They shall not communicate to any person any  information known to them by reason of their official position which has  not been made public, except in the course of their duties or by authorization  of the Director-General. At no time shall they in any way use to private  advantage information known to them by reason of their official position.  These obligations do not cease with separation from service.   .  No staff member shall accept any honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration from any government, or from any other source external to  the Organization, if such acceptance is incompatible with his status as an  international civil servant.   .  Any staff member who becomes a candidate for a public office of a  political character shall resign from the Secretariat.   .  The immunities and privileges attaching to the World Health  Organization by virtue of Article    of the Constitution are conferred in the  interests of the Organization. These privileges and immunities furnish no  excuse to staff members for non-performance of their private obligations or  failure to observe laws and police regulations. The decision whether to  waive any privileges or immunities of the staff in any case that arises shall  rest with the Director-General.   .   All staff members shall subscribe to the following oath or declaration:  I solemnly swear (undertake, affirm, promise) to exercise in all loyalty,  discretion, and conscience the functions entrusted to me as an  international civil servant of the World Health Organization, to  discharge those functions and regulate my conduct with the interests  of the World Health Organization only in view, and not to seek or  accept instructions in regard to the performance of my duties from any  government or other authority external to the Organization.   .   The oath or declaration shall be made orally by the Director-General  at a public meeting of the World Health Assembly, by each Deputy  Director-General, Assistant Director-General and Regional Director before  the Director-General and in writing by other staff members.            STAFF REGULATIONS OF WHO       II.

Salary  Director-General on the basis of their duties and responsibilities. The salary  and allowance plan shall be determined by the Director-General following  basically the scales of salaries and allowances of the United Nations,  provided that for staff occupying positions subject to local recruitment the  Director-General may establish salaries and allowances in accordance with  best prevailing local practices and that for staff occupying positions subject  to international recruitment the remuneration shall be varied between duty  stations to take into account relative cost of living to the staff members  concerned, standards of living and related factors. Any deviations from the  United Nations scales of salaries and allowances which may be necessary  for the requirements of the World Health Organization shall be subject to  the approval of, or may be authorized by, the Executive Board.  IV. APPOINTMENT, TRANSFER, REASSIGNMENT AND PROMOTION   .  The Director-General shall appoint, transfer, reassign and promote  staff members as required without regard to race, sex or religion.   .  The paramount consideration  transfer,  reassignment or promotion of staff members shall be the necessity of  securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity. Due  regard shall be paid to the importance of recruiting staff members on as wide  a geographical basis as possible.  the appointment,  in   .  So far as is practicable, selection shall be made on a competitive basis;  however, the foregoing shall not apply to the filling of positions by transfer  or reassignment of a staff member without promotion in the interest of the  Organization.                   BASIC DOCUMENTS   .  Without prejudice to the inflow of fresh talent, posts shall be filled by  reassignment of staff members, as defined by, and under conditions  established by, the Director-General, in preference to other persons. This  preference shall also be applied, on a reciprocal basis, to the United Nations  and specialized agencies brought into relationship with the United Nations.   .  The appointment of each Deputy Director-General, Assistant  Director-General and Regional Director shall be for a period not to exceed  five years, subject to renewal, and in accordance with conditions determined  by the Executive Board concerning eligibility of Regional Directors for  reappointment.

XII. GENERAL PROVISIONS    .  These regulations may be supplemented or amended by the Health  Assembly, without prejudice to the acquired rights of staff members.    .  The Director-General shall report annually to the Health Assembly  such staff rules and amendments thereto as he may make to implement these  regulations, after confirmation by the Executive Board.    .  The Director-General, by virtue of the authority vested in him as the  chief technical and administrative officer of the Organization, may delegate  to other officers of the Organization such of his powers as he considers  necessary for the effective implementation of these regulations.    .  In case of doubt as to the meaning of any of the foregoing regulations,  the Director-General is authorized to rule thereon subject to confirmation of  the ruling by the Executive Board at its next meeting.  ––––––––––              REGULATIONS FOR EXPERT ADVISORY PANELS AND  COMMITTEES   INTRODUCTION  Efficiency, as well as economy, makes it necessary to limit the number  of experts participating in discussions on any given subject; on the other  hand, it is difficult, in a small group of experts, to obtain adequate  representation of the various branches of knowledge which bear upon its  subject, and of the diversified forms of local experience and trends of  thought prevailing in the various parts of the world.  These apparently conflicting requirements may be reconciled by giving  expert committees, whenever desirable, flexible membership.  This may be done by setting up advisory panels of experts conversant  with all the required branches of knowledge and forms of experience needed  to cover adequately a particular subject and providing adequate  geographical representation.  From these panels will be drawn the members of the expert committees,  selection being made according to the agenda of each meeting.  The following regulations are, therefore, based on the above principles.   . DEFINITIONS   .  An expert advisory panel consists of experts from whom the  Organization may obtain technical guidance and support within a particular  subject, either by correspondence or at meetings to which the experts may  be invited.   .  A member of an expert advisory panel is an expert appointed by the  Director-General who undertakes to contribute by correspondence technical  information on developments in his or her field, and to offer advice as  appropriate, spontaneously or upon request.   .  An expert committee is a group of expert advisory panel members  convened by the Director-General for the purpose of reviewing and making  technical recommendations on a subject of interest to the Organization.  _________    Text adopted by the Thirty-fifth World Health Assembly (resolution WHA  .  ), in replacement of  the regulations adopted by the Fourth World Health Assembly. Amendments were adopted at the Forty-fifth,  Forty-ninth, Fifty-third and Fifty-fifth World Health Assemblies (decision WHA  (  ), resolution  WHA  .  , resolution WHA  .  and resolution WHA  .  , respectively).  –     –           BASIC DOCUMENTS   .  A member of an expert committee is an expert appointed by the  Director-General to serve at any particular meeting of that committee.   . AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH  EXPERT ADVISORY PANELS AND COMMITTEES   .  An expert advisory panel may be established by the Director-General  in any field as and when required by the development of the Organization’s  programme. It is established for the Organization as a whole and shall be  utilized at whatever level of operation its guidance and support are needed.  An expert advisory panel may be disestablished by the Director-General at  his discretion when its guidance and support are no longer required.   .  The Director-General shall report to the Executive Board on the  establishment or disestablishment of expert advisory panels and on their  membership.   .  The World Health Assembly and the Executive Board have authority  under Articles   (e) and    of the Constitution of the Organization to  establish and dissolve expert committees.   .  The Director-General shall include in his biennial programme budget  such proposals for expert committee meetings as he deems necessary.   . EXPERT ADVISORY PANELS –  MEMBERSHIP AND PROCEDURES   .  Any person possessing qualifications and/or experience relevant and  useful to the activities of the Organization in a field covered by an  established expert advisory panel may be considered for appointment as a  member of that panel after consultations with the national authorities  concerned. Information on all appointments made to these panels shall be  circulated to all Member States. The Director-General shall encourage  developing countries to send nominations for the panels.   .  In the selection of members of expert advisory panels the Director- General shall consider primarily their technical ability and experience, but  he shall also endeavour to ensure that the panels have the broadest possible  international representation in terms of diversity of knowledge, experience  and approaches in the fields for which the panels are established. He/she  shall encourage nomination of experts from developing countries and from  all regions and shall be helped in this task by Regional Directors.            REGULATIONS FOR EXPERT ADVISORY PANELS AND COMMITTEES        .  Members of expert advisory panels shall be appointed for such period  as the Director-General may determine, but not exceeding four years.   . .  At the expiration of that period, the appointment shall end. However,  the Director-General may renew the appointment when such renewal is  warranted by specific programme requirements. Renewals of appointments  should be fixed for periods of up to four years.   . .  The appointment shall also end if the panel is disestablished. It may  also be terminated at any time by the Director-General if the interests of the  Organization so require. The Director-General shall report to the Executive  Board on any such early termination of appointment.   .  Members of expert advisory panels do not receive any remuneration  from the Organization. However, when attending meetings by invitation of  WHO, they shall be entitled, in accordance with the administrative  regulations of the Organization, to reimbursement of travelling expenses  and to a daily living allowance during such meetings.   . EXPERT COMMITTEES – MEMBERSHIP AND PROCEDURES Selection, Appointment and Term of Office of Members   .  The Director-General shall establish the number of experts to be  invited to a meeting of an expert committee, determine its date and duration,  and convene the committee.   .  As a general rule, the Director-General shall select from one or more  expert advisory panels the members of an expert committee on the basis of  the principles of equitable geographical representation, gender balance, a  balance of experts from developed and developing countries, representation  of different trends of thought, approaches and practical experience in  various parts of the world, and an appropriate interdisciplinary balance. The  membership of expert committees shall not be restricted by consideration  of language, within the range of languages of the Organization.   .  Members of an expert advisory panel who are not invited to a  particular meeting of an expert committee of interest to them may at their  request attend as observers, if so authorized by the Director-General, but  shall do so at their own expense.  the United Nations system, as well as   .  Organizations of  nongovernmental organizations in official relations with WHO, may be  invited to send representatives to expert committee meetings in which they  are directly interested.       BASIC DOCUMENTS   .  To ensure balanced geographical representation, consultants and  temporary advisers assigned to assist an expert committee shall be selected,  as far as possible, from countries not represented on the committee’s  membership.  International Status of Members   .  In the exercise of their functions, the members of expert advisory  panels and committees shall act as international experts serving the  Organization exclusively; in that capacity they may not request or receive  instructions from any government or authority external to the Organization.  Furthermore, they shall disclose all circumstances that could give rise to a  potential conflict of interest as a result of their membership of an expert  committee, in accordance with the mechanisms established by the Director- General for that purpose.   .  They shall enjoy the privileges and immunities envisaged in  Article   (b) of the Constitution of the Organization and set forth in the  Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the Specialized Agencies  and in Annex VII thereof.  Agenda   .  The Director-General, or his representative, shall prepare the draft  agenda for each meeting and transmit it in reasonable time to the members  of the committee and of the Executive Board, and to Members of the  Organization. An expert committee, unless formally so requested, may not  deal with questions of administrative policy. The agenda shall include any  subject, within the terms of reference of the committee, proposed by the  Health Assembly, the Executive Board or the Director-General.   .  In order to provide members of an expert committee with the broadest  possible information on the subjects under discussion, the terms of reference  and annotated agenda of the meeting shall be supplied in advance to  members of expert advisory panels who are conversant with these subjects  but have not been invited to the meeting. They may also be invited to  provide written contributions and may receive the principal working  documents.  Expert Sub-committees   .   For the study of special problems a committee may suggest the  establishment, temporarily or permanently, of specialized sub-committees,  and may make suggestions as to their composition. A committee may also  suggest the establishment of joint sub-committees consisting of specialists             REGULATIONS FOR EXPERT ADVISORY PANELS AND COMMITTEES       in its own technical field and of specialists in another field whose  collaboration it considers necessary for the success of its work. The Health  Assembly, or  the Executive Board, shall decide whether such  sub-committees shall be established, and whether singly or jointly with  other committees or sub-committees of the Organization.   .   The rules governing the functions of committees, the appointment of  their members, the election of their chairmen and vice-chairmen,  secretaryship and agenda shall, mutatis mutandis, apply to sub-committees.  Membership of a committee does not in itself entitle an expert to participate  in the proceedings of any of its sub-committees.  Reports on Meetings of Committees   .   For each meeting an expert committee shall draw up a report setting  forth its findings, observations and recommendations. This report shall be  completed and approved by the expert committee before the end of its  meeting. Its conclusions and recommendations shall not commit the  Organization and should be formulated in such a way as to advise the  Director-General on future programme activities without calling upon him  to use the staff, services or funds of the Organization in any specified way.  If the committee is not unanimous in its findings, any divergent views shall  be recorded in or appended to the report. Signed contributions may not be  included in the text of the expert committee’s report or in its annexes.   .   The text of an expert committee report may not be modified without  the committee’s consent. The Director-General may direct to the attention  of the chairman of an expert committee any statement of opinion in its report  that might be considered prejudicial to the best interests of the Organization  or of any Member State. The chairman of the committee may, at his  discretion, delete such statement from the report, with or without  communicating with members of the expert committee, or, after obtaining  their written approval, may modify the statement. Any difficulty arising out  of a divergence of views between the Director-General and the chairman of  the committee shall be referred to the Executive Board.   .   The Director-General shall be responsible for authorizing the  publication of  the  Director-General may communicate the report directly to the Health  Assembly if, in his opinion, it contains information or advice urgently  required by that body.  reports of expert committees. Nevertheless,   .   The Director-General may publish or authorize the publication of any  document prepared for an expert committee, with due recognition of  authorship if applicable.               BASIC DOCUMENTS  Reports on Meetings of Sub-committees   .   The above provisions (paragraphs  .  – .  ) shall apply to reports on  meetings of sub-committees, except that the report of a sub-committee or  joint sub-committee shall be submitted through the Director-General to the  parent committee or committees. Nevertheless, the Director-General may  communicate the report of a sub-committee directly to the Executive Board  or to the Health Assembly if, in his opinion, it contains information or  advice urgently required by either of those bodies.  Venue of Meetings of Committees   .   Meetings of expert committees shall normally be held at headquarters  in order to provide overall technical guidance. They may also be convened  at regional level, to deal with problems of a predominantly regional  character, or at country level, if the health problems under consideration are  essentially country-specific. Meetings of such expert committees shall be  planned in a coordinated manner so as to complement those convened at  headquarters, avoid duplication, and ensure maximum effectiveness and  coherence in their work.   .   The above provisions (paragraphs  . – .  ) shall be applicable,  mutatis mutandis, to expert committees that meet at the regional or country  level. The Director-General may delegate the necessary authority to the  Regional Directors.  Rules of Procedure   .   Expert committees and sub-committees shall conduct  their  proceedings in accordance with the Rules of Procedure set forth in the annex  to these regulations.  Joint Committees and Sub-committees   .   The selection and appointment of expert advisory panel members  designated by the Director-General to serve on a joint committee or  sub-committee convened by the Organization in conjunction with other  organizations shall also be governed by these regulations. In this selection,  account shall be taken of the technical and geographical balance that is  desirable for the joint committee or sub-committee as a whole.   .   Members of expert advisory panels appointed by the Director-General  to such joint committees and sub-committees shall retain complete freedom  of opinion and expression. Therefore their participation in any collective  decision which may entail administrative, financial or moral responsibility  for another participating organization does not commit the Organization.   REGULATIONS FOR EXPERT ADVISORY PANELS AND COMMITTEES        .   Members of expert advisory panels representing the Organization on  any joint committee or sub-committee shall report to the Director-General  on their participation. This report shall be supplementary to the collective  report of the joint committee or sub-committee itself.  Reporting to the Executive Board   .   The Director-General shall submit to the Executive Board a report on  meetings of expert committees held since the previous session of the Board.  It shall contain his observations on the implications of the expert committee  reports and his recommendations on the follow-up action to be taken, and  the texts of the recommendations of the expert committee shall be annexed.  The Executive Board shall consider the report submitted by the  Director-General and address its comments to it.   . ENTRY-INTO-FORCE   .  These regulations shall apply as from the date of their approval by the  Health Assembly.  Annex  RULES OF PROCEDURE FOR EXPERT COMMITTEES  PRIVATE NATURE OF MEETINGS  Rule    The meetings of expert committees shall normally be of a private  character. They cannot become public except by the express decision of the  committee with the full agreement of the Director-General.  QUORUM  Rule    The discussions of an expert committee shall be valid:  (a) if at least two-thirds of its members are present; and  (b) if, unless otherwise authorized by the Director-General, a  representative of the Director-General is also present.               BASIC DOCUMENTS  CHAIRMAN, VICE-CHAIRMAN AND RAPPORTEUR  Rule    The expert committee shall elect, from among its members, a chairman  to direct its debates, a vice-chairman to replace the chairman if necessary,  and a rapporteur.  SECRETARYSHIP  Rule     . In accordance with Article    of the Constitution of the Organization, the  Director-General is ex officio secretary of all expert committees. He may  delegate those functions to a technical officer competent in the subject  concerned.   . The Director-General, or his representative, may at any time make either  oral or written statements to the committee concerning any question under  consideration.   . The Director-General, or his representative, shall determine the time and  place of the meeting and shall convene the committee.   . The committee’s secretariat, composed of the secretary and of staff  members, consultants and temporary advisers, as required, shall assist the  chairman, the rapporteur and the members of the committee.  AGENDA  Rule     . The secretary of the meeting shall prepare the draft agenda, submit it to  the Director-General for approval, and transmit it to the members of the  committee together with the letter of invitation to the meeting.   . The agenda shall include any subject within the terms of reference of the  committee proposed by the Health Assembly, the Executive Board or the  Director-General.             REGULATIONS FOR EXPERT ADVISORY PANELS AND COMMITTEES       VOTE  Rule    Scientific questions shall not be submitted to a vote. If the members of  a committee cannot agree, each shall be entitled to have his personal opinion  reflected in the report; this statement of opinion shall take the form of an  individual or group report, stating the reasons why a divergent opinion is  held.  CONDUCT OF BUSINESS  Rule    Save as provided in Rule   above, the chairman shall be guided by the  provisions of the Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board on the conduct  of business and voting in the committee in so far as this may be necessary  for the accomplishment of the work of the committee.  REPORTS  Rule    The expert committee shall draw up and approve its report before the  closure of its meeting.  WORKING LANGUAGES  Rule     . The working languages of the expert committee shall be English and  French. The Secretariat shall make such arrangements as are necessary to  provide for interpretation from and into the other official languages of the  Health Assembly and the Executive Board.   . For expert committees held at regional or country level, working  languages of that region other than English and French may be chosen as  the committee’s working languages; arrangements may be made for  interpretation from and into other languages as required.  ––––––––––          REGULATIONS FOR STUDY AND SCIENTIFIC GROUPS,  COLLABORATING INSTITUTIONS  AND OTHER MECHANISMS OF COLLABORATION   INTRODUCTION  The World Health Organization requires expert advice for overall  scientific and technical guidance, as well as for direct support of global,  interregional and regional technical cooperation programmes for national  health development.  Such advice and support must reflect high scientific and technical  standards, the widest possible representation of different branches of  knowledge, and local experience and trends of thought throughout the world,  and must cover a broad range of disciplines related to health and social  development.  Expert advice and support may be obtained from and provided by  individuals, groups and institutions.  The present regulations do not cover:  (a) advice obtained from members of expert advisory panels acting  individually or collaborating in expert committees;   (b) expert advice available informally;  (c) expertise provided at regional level on problems of a regional or  subregional character;  (d) advice obtained through channels covered by other regulations (e.g.  from non-governmental organizations); or  (e) scientific and technical meetings other than those of expert  committees, study groups and scientific groups, and especially  meetings concerned with and adapted to special programmes (e.g.  the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical  Diseases, the Special Programme of Research, Development and  Research Training in Human Reproduction, the Diarrhoeal Diseases  Control Programme, the International Programme on Chemical  Safety).  _________    Text approved by the Executive Board at its sixty-ninth session (resolution EB  .R  ) with  amendments approved at its    th session (resolution EB   .R ).    For regulations for expert advisory panels and committees, see pp.    –   .  –     –           BASIC DOCUMENTS  Adherence to the principles underlying these regulations is essential, but  practical application must be responsive to evolving demands on the  Organization, and new ways and means of securing and using expertise may  prove necessary.   . STUDY GROUPS  .  Study groups may be convened instead of expert committees when one  or more of the following conditions are met:  – the knowledge on the subject to be studied is still too uncertain and the opinions of competent specialists are too diverse for there to be a reasonable expectation of authoritative conclusions which can be immediately utilized by the Organization; – the study envisaged concerns too limited an aspect of a general problem, which may or may not come within the purview of an expert committee; – the study envisaged  implies the collaboration of narrowly specialized participants who may belong  to very different disciplines and on whom the Organization occasionally calls, without its being necessary, however, to include them in its expert advisory panels; – certain non-technical factors render unsuitable an expert committee meeting, which would be too official in character; – urgent or exceptional circumstances call for some administrative procedure which will be simpler and more rapidly applicable than that involved in meetings of expert committees.  .  The Director-General has authority to convene study groups, to  determine the nature and scope of their subjects, the date and duration of  their meetings, their membership, and whether their reports should be  published. In so doing, the Director-General shall follow, whenever  applicable and as far as practicable, the principles and rules applicable to  expert committees, particularly those concerning the technical and  geographical balance of the groups. Members of study groups may be  members of expert advisory panels or other experts.   .  The regulations applying to the reports and documents of expert  committees shall also apply to the reports and documents of study groups.   .  Meetings of study groups may be held at the regional level, to deal  with subjects essentially of regional interest, when one or more of the  REGULATIONS FOR STUDY AND SCIENTIFIC GROUPS       conditions outlined in paragraph  .  above are met. Such study groups may  be convened by Regional Directors, who will apply to them the provisions  of regulation  .  above, mutatis mutandis, and ensure optimal coordination  between such study group meetings and meetings on the same or related  subjects in other regions or at headquarters level.   .  Should a study group be convened in conjunction with another  organization, Regulations  .   to  .   concerning expert advisory panels  and committees shall apply, mutatis mutandis.   .  In the exercise of their functions the members of WHO expert advisory  panels and other experts participating in study group meetings shall act as  international experts serving the Organization exclusively; in that capacity  they may not request or receive instructions from any government or  authority external to the Organization. They shall enjoy the privileges and  immunities envisaged in Article   (b) of the Constitution of the  Organization and set forth in the Convention on the Privileges and  Immunities of the Specialized Agencies and in Annex VII thereof.   . SCIENTIFIC GROUPS   .  The functions of scientific groups are to review given fields of medical,  health and health systems research, to assess the current state of knowledge  in those fields, and to determine how that knowledge may best be extended.  In other words, scientific groups play for research a role comparable to that  of expert committees and study groups for the Organization’s programme  in general.   .  The Director-General has authority to convene scientific groups and  to determine the nature and scope of their subjects, the date and duration of  their meetings, and their membership. In so doing, the Director-General  should follow, whenever applicable and as far as practicable, the principles  and rules applicable to expert committees. Members of scientific groups  may be members of expert advisory panels or other experts.   .  The Director-General shall submit the reports of scientific groups to  the global Advisory Committee on Health Research,  and the reports may  be published at his discretion.   .  Meetings of scientific groups may be held at the regional level, to deal  with subjects essentially of regional interest. Such scientific groups may be  convened by Regional Directors, who will apply to them the provisions of  _________    The former title (Advisory Committee on Medical Research) was changed by the Thirty-ninth World  Health Assembly in its decision WHA  ( ).                 BASIC DOCUMENTS  Regulation  .  above, mutatis mutandis, and ensure optimal coordination  between such scientific group meetings and meetings on the same or related  subjects in other regions or at headquarters level.   .  Should a scientific group be convened in conjunction with another  organization, regulations  .   to  .   concerning expert advisory panels  and committees shall apply, mutatis mutandis.   .  In the exercise of their functions the members of WHO expert advisory  panels and other experts participating in scientific group meetings shall act  as international experts serving the Organization exclusively; in that  capacity they may not request or receive instructions from any government  or authority external to the Organization. They shall enjoy the privileges  and immunities envisaged in Article   (b) of the Constitution of the  Organization and set forth in the Convention on the Privileges and  Immunities of the Specialized Agencies and in Annex VII thereof.   . WHO COLLABORATING CENTRES  Definition and Functions   .  A WHO collaborating centre is an institution designated by the  Director-General to form part of an international collaborative network  carrying out activities in support of the Organization’s programme at all  levels. A department or laboratory within an institution or a group of  facilities for reference, research or training belonging to different  institutions may be designated as a centre, one institution acting for them in  relations with the Organization.   .  Institutions showing a growing capacity to fulfil a function or  functions related to the Organization’s programme, as well as institutions of  high scientific and technical standing having attained international  recognition, may qualify for designation as WHO collaborating centres.   .  The functions of WHO collaborating centres, severally or collectively,  include the following:  (a) collection, collation and dissemination of information;  (b) standardization of terminology and nomenclature, of technology,  of diagnostic, therapeutic and prophylactic substances, and of  methods and procedures;  (c) development and application of appropriate technology;  (d) provision of reference substances and other services;            REGULATIONS FOR STUDY AND SCIENTIFIC GROUPS       (e) participation in collaborative research developed under the  Organization’s  the planning, conduct,  monitoring and evaluation of research, as well as promotion of the  application of the results of research;  leadership,  including  (f) training, including research training; and  (g) the coordination of activities carried out by several institutions on  a given subject.   .  A WHO collaborating centre participates on a contractual basis in  cooperative programmes supported by the Organization at the country,  intercountry, regional, interregional and global levels. It also contributes to  increasing technical cooperation with and among countries by providing  them with information, services and advice, and by stimulating and  supporting research and training.  Designation   .  The criteria to be applied in the selection of institutions for designation  as a WHO collaborating centre are as follows:  (a) the scientific and technical standing of the institution concerned at  the national and international levels;  (b) the place the institution occupies in the country’s health, scientific  or educational structures;  (c) the quality of its scientific and technical leadership, and the number  and qualifications of its staff;  (d) the institution’s prospective stability in terms of personnel, activity  and funding;  (e) the working relationship which the institution has developed with  other institutions in the country, as well as at the intercountry,  regional and global levels;  (f) the institution’s ability, capacity and readiness to contribute,  individually and within networks, to WHO programme activities,  whether in support of country programmes or by participating in  international cooperative activities;  (g) the technical and geographical relevance of the institution and its  activities to WHO’s programme priorities;  (h) the successful completion by the institution of at least two years of  collaboration with WHO in carrying out jointly planned activities.                 BASIC DOCUMENTS   .  Regional Directors shall propose institutions for designation as WHO  collaborating centres by the Director-General. They shall do so on the basis  of preliminary exploration with the institutions and national authorities  concerned and with the advice of and on suggestions from the  Organization’s programme officers responsible, at both global and regional  level, for the programmes concerned.   .  Regional Directors shall provide  appropriate information concerning:  the Director-General with  (a) the programme requirements to which the prospective centre is  expected to respond and the functions it will have to perform;  (b) the suitability of the institution concerned, on the basis of the  criteria laid down in these regulations and by the Director-General;  and  (c) the government’s and institution’s agreement to the proposed  designation.   .  Designation shall be by agreement with the administrative head of the  institution after consultation with the national authorities. The designation  shall be signified to the institution and the national authorities by the  Regional Director concerned.   .  After designation, an institution shall be known by the official title  “WHO Collaborating Centre”, followed by a concise indication of the  sphere of activity covered.   .   WHO collaborating centres shall be designated for an initial period of  four years. The designation is renewable for the same or shorter periods, if  warranted by programme requirements and the results of evaluation.  Management   .   Collaboration with the centres shall be managed by relevant  programme officers in that part of the Organization which initiated the  designation process, whether at headquarters or in a region. Collaborating  centres, however, shall maintain their technical links with all parts of the  Organization relevant to their agreed programme of work.   . NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS RECOGNIZED BY WHO   .  For collaborative activities of such scope or nature as may not warrant  the designation of a WHO collaborating centre, the Organization may  propose that an institution that is able and willing to participate in such            REGULATIONS FOR STUDY AND SCIENTIFIC GROUPS       activities with WHO be designated by the national authorities concerned for  that purpose.   .  Upon designation by the national authorities, such institution shall be  formally acknowledged by the Organization as a national institution  recognized by WHO. However, no reference to WHO may be included in  the title of the institution.   .  An agreement shall specify the tasks to be performed by the institution  and the technical contributions to be provided by the Organization.   .  Official recognition by the Organization shall be for one year and shall  be tacitly renewed unless notice is given by either party three months in  advance.   .  The acknowledgement of such recognition of a national institution by  WHO shall be signified to the government and to the institution concerned  by the Regional Director. Working technical relationships with the  institution shall be developed at regional or headquarters level, as  appropriate.   .  National institutions recognized by WHO shall be authorized by their  respective governments, when such authorization is necessary, to maintain  direct working relations with the Organization and with WHO collaborating  centres.   . OTHER MECHANISMS OF COLLABORATION   .  Other mechanisms of collaboration with individual experts, expert  groups and institutions – for example by contractual technical service  agreement – are developed by the Organization in response to particular  requirements.   .  These mechanisms are mostly based on the very close involvement of  individual experts, expert groups and institutions in the definition of  programme objectives, the formulation of strategic plans to attain those  objectives, the implementation of those plans, and the monitoring of  progress.   .  The Director-General shall apply to these mechanisms the working  procedures he deems most effective, even though these procedures may  differ from those provided for in these regulations and those pertaining to  expert advisory panels and committees. These mechanisms, however, shall  be in general conformity with the principles outlined in these regulations,                 BASIC DOCUMENTS  especially concerning the adequate international and technical distribution  of expertise.   .  All new developments in the Organization’s collaboration with  individual experts, expert groups and institutions shall be subjected to the  monitoring and evaluation procedures outlined below.   . MONITORING AND EVALUATION   .  In the development of its individual, collective and institutional  mechanisms for expert guidance and support, the Organization must be able  to rely on adequate monitoring and evaluation procedures.   .  The Director-General shall develop those procedures, using to the full  the technical resources of the Secretariat as well as scientific and technical  advisory bodies dealing with various aspects of the Organization’s  programme, in particular the global and regional advisory committees on  health research.    .  The Director-General shall report to the Executive Board, from time  to time, on the results obtained and on any difficulties encountered in giving  effect to the above regulations, and shall propose action to ensure their  maximum effectiveness.  ––––––––––  _________    See footnote  , p.    .              RULES OF PROCEDURE  OF THE WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY ,   Note: Whenever any of the following terms appear in these Rules, reference shall be  as indicated below:  “Constitution” – to the Constitution of the World Health Organization  “Organization” – to the World Health Organization  “Health Assembly” – to the World Health Assembly  “Board” – to the Executive Board  “Members” – to Members of the World Health Organization  “Associate Members” – to Associate Members of the World Health Organization  “Financial period” – to a period of two consecutive calendar years beginning with an  even-numbered year.  “Official relations” – to a privilege that the Executive Board may grant to  nongovernmental organizations, international business associations and philanthropic  foundations in accordance with the Framework of Engagement with Non-State Actors.  ––––––––––  Preamble  These Rules of Procedure are adopted under the authority of, and are  subject to, the Constitution of the World Health Organization.

Rule     Proposals and amendments shall normally be introduced in writing and  handed to the Director-General, who shall circulate copies to the delegations.  RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE HEALTH ASSEMBLY       Except as may be decided otherwise by the Health Assembly, no proposal  shall be discussed or put to the vote at any meeting of the Health Assembly  unless copies of it have been circulated to all delegations at least two days  previously. The President may, however, permit the discussion and  consideration of amendments, even though they have not been circulated or  have only been circulated the same day.  Rule     The reports of all committees shall be submitted by these committees to  a plenary meeting. Such reports, including draft resolutions, shall be  distributed, in so far as practicable, at least    hours in advance of the  plenary meeting at which they are to be considered. Such reports, including  draft resolutions annexed thereto, shall not be read aloud in the plenary  meetings unless the President decides otherwise.  Rule     A majority of the Members represented at the session shall constitute a  quorum for the conduct of business at plenary meetings of the Health  Assembly.  Rule     No delegate may address the Health Assembly without having  previously obtained the permission of the President. The President shall call  upon speakers in the order in which they signify their desire to speak. The  President may call a speaker to order if his remarks are not relevant to the  subject under discussion.  Rule     The Director-General or a member of the Secretariat designated by her  or him may at any time make either oral or written statements to the Health  Assembly or to any of its committees or subdivisions concerning any  question under consideration.  The Health Assembly may limit the time allowed to each speaker.  Rule          BASIC DOCUMENTS  Rule     During the discussion of any matter a delegate or a representative of an  Associate Member may rise to a point of order  and the point of order shall  be immediately decided by the President. A delegate or a representative of  an Associate Member may appeal against the ruling of the President, in  which case the appeal shall immediately be put to the vote. A delegate or a  representative of an Associate Member rising to a point of order may not  speak on the substance of the matter under discussion, but on the point of  order only.  Rule     The right of reply shall be accorded by the President to any delegate or  representative of an Associate Member who requests it. Delegates and  representatives of Associate Members should in exercising this right  attempt to be as brief as possible and preferably deliver their statements at  the end of the meeting at which this right is requested.  Rule     During the course of a debate the President may announce the list of  speakers and, with the consent of the Health Assembly, declare the list  closed. He or she may, however, accord the right of reply to any member if  in her or his opinion a speech delivered after he or she has declared the list  closed makes this desirable.  Rule     During the discussion of any matter, a delegate or a representative of an  Associate Member may move the suspension or the adjournment of the  meeting or the suspension of the debate. Such motions shall not be debated,  but shall immediately be put to a vote.  For the purpose of these Rules “suspension of the meeting” means the  temporary postponement of the business of the meeting, “adjournment of  the meeting” the termination of all business until another meeting is called,  and “suspension of the debate” the postponement of further discussion on  the matter under discussion until later in the same session.  Rule     During the discussion of any matter a delegate or a representative of an  Associate Member may move the adjournment of the debate on the item  _________    For description of the concept of a point of order, see pp.    –   .  RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE HEALTH ASSEMBLY       under discussion. In addition to the proposer of the motion, one speaker may  speak in favour of, and one against, the motion, after which the motion to  adjourn the debate shall be immediately put to the vote.  Rule     A delegate or a representative of an Associate Member may at any time  move the closure of the debate on the item under discussion whether or not  any other delegate or representative of an Associate Member has signified  her or his wish to speak. If request is made for permission to speak against  closure, it may be accorded to not more than two speakers, after which the  motion shall be immediately put to the vote. If the Health Assembly decides  in favour of closure, the President shall declare the debate closed. The  Health Assembly shall thereafter vote only on the one or more proposals  moved before the closure.  Rule     The following motions shall have precedence in the following order over  all other proposals or motions before the meeting, except a point of order:  (a) to suspend the meeting; (b) to adjourn the meeting; (c) to adjourn the debate on the item under discussion; and (d) for the closure of the debate on the item under discussion. Rule     Subject to Rule   , any motion calling for a decision on the competence  of the Health Assembly to adopt a proposal submitted to it shall be put to  the vote before a vote is taken on the proposal in question.  Rule     A delegate or a representative of an Associate Member may move that  parts of a proposal or of an amendment shall be voted on separately. If  objection is made to the request for division, the motion for division shall  be voted upon. Permission to speak on the motion for division shall be given  only to two speakers in favour and two speakers against. If the motion for  division is carried, those parts of the proposal or of the amendment which  are subsequently approved shall be put to the vote as a whole. If all operative  parts of the proposal or the amendment have been rejected, the proposal or  the amendment shall be considered to have been rejected as a whole.       BASIC DOCUMENTS  Rule     When an amendment to a proposal is moved, the amendment shall be  voted on first. When two or more amendments to a proposal are moved, the  Health Assembly shall first vote on the amendment deemed by the President  to be furthest removed in substance from the original proposal, and then on  the amendment next removed therefrom, and so on, until all the  amendments have been put to the vote. Where, however, the adoption of  one amendment necessarily implies the rejection of another amendment, the  latter amendment shall not be put to the vote. If one or more amendments  are adopted, the amended proposal shall then be voted upon. If an  amendment to a proposal has been accepted by the original proposer, such  an amendment shall be deemed to be an integral part of the original proposal  and no separate vote shall be required thereon. A motion is considered an  amendment to a proposal if it merely adds to, deletes from or revises part of  that proposal. A motion which constitutes a substitution for a proposal shall  be considered as a proposal.  Rule     If two or more proposals are moved, the Health Assembly shall, unless  it decides otherwise, vote on the proposals in the order in which they have  been circulated to all delegations, unless the result of a vote on a proposal  makes unnecessary any other voting on the proposal or proposals still  outstanding.  Rule     A motion may be withdrawn by its proposer at any time before voting  on it has commenced, provided that the motion has not been amended or, if  amended, that the proposer of the amendment agrees to the withdrawal. A  motion thus withdrawn may be reintroduced by any delegate.  Rule     When a proposal has been adopted or rejected, it may not be  reconsidered at the same session unless the Health Assembly, by a two- thirds majority of the Members present and voting, so decides. Permission  to speak on a motion to reconsider shall be accorded only to two speakers  opposing the motion, after which it shall immediately be put to a vote. The  correction of a clerical or arithmetical error in any document concerning a  proposal which has already been adopted shall not be considered as  requiring the reopening of the debate on such proposal by a two-thirds  majority vote.  RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE HEALTH ASSEMBLY       VOTING IN PLENARY MEETINGS  Rule     Each Member shall have one vote in the Health Assembly. For the  purposes of these Rules, the phrase “Members present and voting” means  Members casting a valid affirmative or negative vote. Members abstaining  from voting are considered as not voting.  Rule     Decisions by the Health Assembly on important questions shall be made  by a two-thirds majority of the Members present and voting. These  questions shall include: the adoption of conventions or agreements; the  approval of agreements bringing the Organization into relation with the  United Nations and with intergovernmental organizations and agencies in  accordance with Articles   ,    and    of the Constitution; amendments to  the Constitution; decisions on the amount of the effective working budget;  and decisions to suspend the voting privileges and services of a Member  under Article   of the Constitution.  Rule     The Director-General of the World Health Organization shall be elected  by a clear and strong majority of members present and voting as set forth in  Rule     of these Rules of Procedure.  Rule     Except as stipulated otherwise in these Rules, decisions on other  questions, including the determination of additional categories of questions  to be decided by a two-thirds majority, shall be made by a majority of the  Members present and voting.  Rule     The Health Assembly shall normally vote by show of hands, except that  any delegate may request a recorded vote. Where an appropriate electronic  system is available, the Health Assembly may decide to conduct any vote  under this Rule by electronic means.                 BASIC DOCUMENTS  Rule     When the Health Assembly conducts a recorded vote without using  electronic means, the vote shall be conducted by roll-call, which shall be  taken in the English or French alphabetical order of the names of the  Members. The name of the Member to vote first shall be determined by lot.  Rule     The vote of each Member participating in a recorded vote shall be  inserted in the record of the meeting.  Rule     After the President has announced the beginning of voting, no delegate  shall interrupt the voting except on a point of order in connexion with the  actual conduct of voting.  Rule     After the voting has been completed, a delegate may make a brief  statement, consisting solely of an explanation of vote. A sponsor of a  proposal shall not speak in explanation of vote thereon, except if it has been  amended.  Rule     In addition to the cases provided for elsewhere by these Rules, the  Health Assembly may vote on any matter by secret ballot if it has previously  so decided by a majority of the Members present and voting, provided that  no secret ballot may be taken on budgetary questions.  A decision under this Rule by the Health Assembly whether or not to  vote by secret ballot may only be taken by a show of hands; if the Assembly  has decided to vote on a particular question by secret ballot, no other mode  of voting may be requested or decided upon.  Rule     When the Health Assembly votes by secret ballot, the ballot itself and  the check of the number of ballot papers shall take place in plenary meeting.  Unless the Health Assembly determines otherwise the counting of votes  shall take place in a separate room to which delegations shall have access.  This counting shall take place under the supervision of the President or of  one of the Vice-Presidents of the Health Assembly. The Health Assembly            RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE HEALTH ASSEMBLY       may proceed with its work during the period before the results of the ballot  can be announced.  Rule     Elections shall normally be held by secret ballot.   Subject to the  provisions of Rule    , and in the absence of any objection, the Health  Assembly may decide to proceed without taking a ballot on an agreed  candidate or list of candidates. Where a ballot is required, two or more  tellers appointed by the President from among the delegations present shall  assist in the counting of votes.  Rule     When only one person or Member is to be elected and no candidate  obtains in the first ballot the majority required, a second ballot shall be taken  which shall be restricted to the two candidates obtaining the largest number  of votes. If in the second ballot the votes are equally divided, the President  shall decide between the candidates by drawing lots.  Rule     When two or more elective places are to be filled at one time under the  same conditions, those candidates obtaining in the first ballot the majority  required shall be elected. If the number of candidates obtaining such  majority is less than the number of persons or Members to be elected, there  shall be additional ballots to fill the remaining places, the ballots being  restricted to the candidates obtaining the greatest number of votes in the  previous ballot to a number not more than twice the places remaining to be  filled; provided that, after the third inconclusive ballot, votes may be cast  for any eligible person or Member. If three such unrestricted ballots are  inconclusive, the next three ballots shall be restricted to the candidates who  obtained the greatest number of votes in the third of the unrestricted ballots,  to a number not more than twice the places remaining to be filled, and the  following three ballots thereafter shall be unrestricted, and so on until all  the places have been filled.  Rule     In an election each Member, unless he or she abstains, shall vote for that  number of candidates equal to the number of elective places to be filled.  _________    For Guiding Principles for the Conduct of Elections by Secret Ballot, see pp.    –   .       BASIC DOCUMENTS  Any ballot paper on which there are more or fewer names than there are  elective places to be filled shall be null and void.  Rule     If during an election one or more elective places cannot be filled by  reason of an equal number of votes having been obtained by two or more  candidates, a ballot shall be held among such candidates to determine which  of them will be elected. This procedure may be repeated if necessary. If the  votes are equally divided on a matter other than an election the proposal  shall be regarded as not adopted.  CONDUCT OF BUSINESS AND VOTING IN COMMITTEES  AND SUBCOMMITTEES  Rule     Subject to any decision of the Health Assembly, the procedure  governing the conduct of business and voting by committees shall conform  as far as practicable to the Rules relative to the conduct of business and  voting in plenary meetings. One third of the members of a committee shall  constitute a quorum. The presence of a majority of a committee shall,  however, be required for a question to be put to a vote.  Rule     The Chair of each subcommittee shall apply the Rules applicable to  committees to the work of such subcommittee only in so far as he or she  considers it advisable with a view to expediting the dispatch of business.  LANGUAGES   Rule     Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish shall be both the  official and the working languages of the Health Assembly.  _________    See resolution WHA  .   (    ).            RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE HEALTH ASSEMBLY       Rule     Speeches made in an official language shall be interpreted into the other  official languages.  Rule     Any delegate or any representative of an Associate Member or any  representative of the Board may speak in a language other than the official  languages. In this case he or she shall herself or himself provide for  interpretation into one of the official languages. Interpretation into the other  official languages by interpreters of the Secretariat may be based on the  interpretation given in the first such language.  Rule     Verbatim and summary records and the Journal of the Health Assembly  shall be drawn up in the working languages.  Rule     All resolutions, recommendations and other formal decisions of the  Health Assembly shall be made available in the working languages.  RECORDS OF THE HEALTH ASSEMBLY  Rule     Verbatim records of all plenary meetings and summary records of the  meetings of the General Committee and of committees and subcommittees  shall be made by the Secretariat. Unless otherwise expressly decided by the  committee concerned, no record shall be made of the proceedings of the  Committee on Credentials other than the report presented by the Committee  to the Health Assembly.  Rule     The summary records referred to in Rule    shall be sent as soon as  possible to delegations, to representatives of Associate Members and to the  representatives of the Board, who shall inform the Secretariat in writing not  later than    hours thereafter of any corrections they wish to have made.                 BASIC DOCUMENTS  Rule     As soon as possible after the close of each session, copies of all verbatim  and summary records, resolutions, recommendations and other formal  decisions adopted by the Health Assembly shall be transmitted by the  Director-General to Members and Associate Members, to the United  Nations and to all specialized agencies with which the Organization has  entered into effective relations. The records of private meetings shall be  transmitted to the participants only.  Rule     Verbatim and summary records of public meetings and the reports of all  committees and subcommittees shall be published.

BUDGET AND FINANCE  Rule     The Health Assembly shall:  (a) adopt the budget authorizing expenditure for the next financial period after consideration of the Director-General’s budget estimates and the Board’s recommendations thereon; (b) consider and approve supplementary estimates for the current financial period if and as necessary; (c) examine reports of the auditor on the accounts of receipts and expenditures for the preceding financial year or period and take such action thereon as may be appropriate; (d) consider the report of the Director-General on the payment of Members’ and Associate Members’ contributions. RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE HEALTH ASSEMBLY       Rule     No proposal for a review of the apportionment of the contributions  among Members and Associate Members for the time being in force shall  be placed on the agenda unless it has been communicated to Members and  Associate Members at least    days before the opening of the session, or  unless the Board has recommended such review.  Rule     Except in so far as there is an express provision to the contrary in the  Financial Regulations, the procedure for the consideration of financial  matters shall be governed by these Rules.  EXECUTIVE BOARD  Rule      At each regular session of the Health Assembly, the Members entitled  to designate persons to serve on the Board shall be elected in accordance  with Articles   (b),    and    of the Constitution.  Rule      At the commencement of each regular session of the Health Assembly  the President shall request Members desirous of putting forward suggestions  regarding the annual election of those Members to be entitled to designate  a person to serve on the Board to place their suggestions before the General  Committee. Such suggestions shall reach the Chair of the General  Committee not later than    hours after the President has made the  announcement in accordance with this Rule.  Rule      The General Committee, having regard to the provisions of Chapter VI  of the Constitution, to Rule    , to the suggestions placed before it by  Members, and to the candidatures put forward by the members of the  General Committee during its meeting, shall by secret ballot draw up a list  consisting of at most    Members and at least the same number of Members  as the number of seats to be filled. This list shall be transmitted to the Health  Assembly at least    hours before the Health Assembly convenes for the  purpose of the annual election of Members to be entitled to designate a  person to serve on the Board.       BASIC DOCUMENTS  The General Committee shall recommend in such list to the Health  Assembly the Members which, in the Committee’s opinion, would provide,  if elected, a balanced distribution of the Board as a whole.  Members included in such list other than the Members which, in the  Committee’s opinion, would provide, if elected, a balanced distribution of  the Board as a whole may withdraw their candidatures from the list by  notification to the President not later than the closure of working hours on  the day preceding the annual election by the Health Assembly of Members  to be entitled to designate a person to serve on the Board. Any such  withdrawal shall be published in the Journal of the Health Assembly and  announced by the President prior to the commencement of voting.  Rule      Subject to the provisions of Rule   , the Health Assembly shall elect by  secret ballot from among the Members nominated in accordance with the  provisions of Rule     the Members to be entitled to designate persons to  serve on the Board. Those candidates obtaining the majority required shall  be elected. If after five such ballots one or more seats remain to be filled no  further ballot shall be taken and the General Committee shall be requested  to submit nominations for candidates for the seats remaining to be filled, in  accordance with Rule    , the number of candidates so nominated not  exceeding twice the number of seats remaining to be filled. Additional  ballots shall be taken for the seats remaining to be filled and those  candidates obtaining the majority required shall be elected.  If after three such ballots one or more seats remain to be filled, the  candidate obtaining in the third ballot the least number of votes shall be  eliminated and a further ballot taken, and so on until all the seats have been  filled.  In any ballots taken under the provisions of this Rule no nominations  other than those made in accordance with the provisions of Rule     and  this Rule shall be considered.  Rule      Should a Member, entitled by a previous election to designate a person  to serve on the Board, for any reason surrender such right before the  expiration of the term for which elected, or under the provisions of Rule      have forfeited such right, the Health Assembly, at a regular session, shall  elect another Member to be entitled to designate a person for the remainder  of the period to which the Member having so surrendered or forfeited its  right would otherwise have been entitled. Such election shall, mutatis  mutandis, be subject to Rules   ,    and     to    , provided that not more  than twice the number of candidates for the number of seats vacant shall be            RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE HEALTH ASSEMBLY       nominated and provided that such elections shall precede the annual election  of the Members entitled to designate a person to serve on the Board in  accordance with Rule    .  Rule      The term of office of each Member entitled to designate a person to serve  on the Board shall begin immediately after the closing of the session of the  Health Assembly at which the Member concerned is elected and shall end  immediately after the closing of the session of the Health Assembly during  which the Member is replaced.  Rule      When a person designated to serve on the Board is prevented from  attending a meeting of the Board, the Member concerned may designate an  alternate to serve in her or his place for such a meeting, with the same status  as the person in whose place he or she is serving.  Rule      Should the person designated by any Member to serve on the Board, in  accordance with the provisions of Rules     and    , fail to attend two  consecutive sessions of the Board, that fact shall be reported by the  Director-General to the next session of the Health Assembly and, unless the  Health Assembly decides otherwise, that Member shall be deemed to have  forfeited its right to designate a person to serve on the Board.  THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL  Rule      In pursuance of Article    of the Constitution, the Director-General shall  be appointed by the Health Assembly on the nomination of the Board and  on such terms as the Health Assembly may determine, subject to the  provisions of Rules     to     inclusive. The term of office of the Director- General shall be five years, and he or she shall be eligible for reappointment  once only.  Rule      Whenever the office of Director-General is vacant or notice is received  of a pending vacancy, the Board shall, at its next meeting, make a       BASIC DOCUMENTS  nomination which shall be submitted to the next session of the Health  Assembly. It shall submit at the same time a draft contract establishing the  terms and conditions of appointment, salary and other emoluments attached  to the office.  Rule      The Health Assembly shall consider the Board’s nomination at a private  meeting and shall come to a decision by secret ballot.   . If the Board nominates three persons, the following procedure shall apply: (a) If in the first ballot a candidate obtains a two-thirds majority or more of the Members present and voting, this will be considered a clear and strong majority and he or she will be appointed Director-General. If no candidate obtains the required majority, the candidate having received the least number of votes shall be eliminated. If two candidates tie for the least number of votes, a separate ballot shall be held between them and the candidate receiving the least number of votes shall be eliminated. (b) In  the subsequent ballot, a candidate will be appointed Director-General if he or she obtains a two-thirds majority or more of the Members present and voting which will be considered a clear and strong majority.

If the Board nominates one person, the Health Assembly shall decide by a two-thirds majority of the Members present and voting. Rule      Should the Health Assembly reject the Board’s nomination, the Board  shall submit a fresh proposal as soon as circumstances permit, with due  regard to the desirability of disposing of the matter before the conclusion of  the relevant session of the Health Assembly.  Rule      The contract of appointment shall be approved by the Health Assembly  and shall be signed jointly by the Director-General and by the President of  the Health Assembly acting in the name of the Organization.  Rule      In any case where the Director-General is unable to perform the  functions of her or his office, or in the case of a vacancy in such office, the  senior officer of the Secretariat shall serve as Acting Director-General,  subject to any decision by the Board.

When the counting of the votes is completed, the tellers shall indicate the results in a document  drawn up for this purpose, which they shall sign and hand to the President. The latter, in plenary  meeting, shall announce the results in the following order: number of Members entitled to vote;  number absent; number of abstentions; number of ballot papers null and void; number of Members  present and voting; number required for a majority; names of candidates and the number of votes  secured by each of them, in descending order of the number of votes.  _________    Under Rule    of the Rules of Procedure of the World Health Assembly.  RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE HEALTH ASSEMBLY         . For the purposes of these provisions, the following definitions shall apply:  “Absent” – Members entitled to vote but whose representatives are not present at the  (a)  meeting at which the secret ballot takes place;  (b)  “Number of Members present and voting” – the difference between the number of  Members with the right to vote and the total number of absentees, abstentions and invalid ballot  papers.    . The President shall declare elected candidates who have obtained the required majority.    . The list signed by the tellers and on which the results of the vote have been recorded shall  constitute the official record of the count of the ballot and shall be retained in the Organization’s files.  The ballot papers shall be destroyed immediately after the declaration of the results of the ballot.  Description of the Concept of a Point of Order  (a) A point of order is basically an intervention directed to the presiding officer, requesting her or  him to make use of some power inherent in his office or specifically given her or him under the Rules  of Procedure. It may, for example, relate to the manner in which the debate is conducted, to the  maintenance of order, to the observance of the Rules of Procedure, or to the way in which presiding  officers exercise the powers conferred upon them by the Rules. Under a point of order, a delegate or  a representative of an Associate Member may request the presiding officer to apply a certain Rule of  Procedure or he or she may question the way in which the officer applies the Rule. Thus, within the  scope of the Rules of Procedure, delegates or representatives are enabled to direct the attention of the  presiding officer to violations or misapplications of the Rules by other delegates or representatives  or by the presiding officer herself or himself. A point of order has precedence over any other matter,  including procedural motions (Rules    and   ).  (b) Points of order raised under Rule    involve questions necessitating a ruling by the presiding  officer, subject to possible appeal. They are therefore distinct from the procedural motions provided  for in Rules    to   , which can be decided only by a vote and on which more than one motion may  be entertained at the same time, Rule    laying down the precedence of such motions. They are also  distinct from requests for information or clarification, or from remarks relating to material  arrangements (seating, interpretation system, temperature of the room), documents, translations, etc.,  which – while they may have to be dealt with by the presiding officer – do not require rulings from  her or him. However, in established practice, a delegate or a representative of an Associate Member  intending to submit a procedural motion or to seek information or clarification often rises to “a point  of order” as a means of obtaining the floor. The latter usage, which is based on practical grounds,  should not be confused with the raising of points of order under Rule   .  (c) Under Rule   , a point of order must be immediately decided by the presiding officer in  accordance with the Rules of Procedure; any appeal arising therefrom must also be put immediately  to the vote. It follows that, as a general rule:  (i)  neither a point of order, nor any appeal arising from a ruling thereon, is debatable;  (ii) no point of order on the same or a different subject can be permitted until the initial point  of order and any appeal arising therefrom have been disposed of.                 BASIC DOCUMENTS  Nevertheless, both the presiding officer and delegations may request information or clarification  regarding a point of order. In addition, the presiding officer may, if he or she considers it necessary,  request an expression of views from delegations on a point of order before giving her or his ruling;  in the exceptional cases in which this practice is resorted to, the presiding officer should terminate  the exchange of views and give her or his ruling as soon as he or she is ready to announce that ruling.  (d) Rule    provides that a delegate or a representative of an Associate Member rising to a point of  order may not speak on the substance of the matter under discussion. Consequently, the purely  procedural nature of points of order calls for brevity. The presiding officer is responsible for ensuring  that statements made on a point of order are in conformity with the present description. –––––––––– RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD  OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION ,  MEMBERSHIP AND ATTENDANCE  Rule    The Executive Board (hereinafter referred to as the “Board”) shall, in  accordance with Chapter VI of the Constitution of the World Health  Organization (hereinafter referred to as the “Organization”) and Rules    –     of the Rules of Procedure of the World Health Assembly (hereinafter  referred to as the “Health Assembly”) consist of and be attended by the  persons (hereinafter referred to as the “members”) duly designated to serve  on the Board.

In this case the Board shall be convened within    days following  receipt of the request and the session shall be held at headquarters unless the  Director-General, in consultation with the Chair, determines otherwise. The  _________    For the Framework of Engagement with Non-State Actors, see pp.   –   .  RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD       agenda of such a session shall be limited to the questions having necessitated  that session.  If events occur requiring immediate action under Article   (i) of the  Constitution the Director-General may, in consultation with the Chair,  convene the Board in a special session and shall fix the date and determine  the place of the session.  * Rule    Attendance at meetings of the Board shall, in addition to members of the  Board, their alternates and advisers, be as follows:  (a) public meetings: Member States not represented on the Board, Associate Members, representatives of the United Nations and other organizations identified in Rule   and members of the public; or (b) private meetings: Member States not represented on the Board and Associate Members and the Secretariat; or (c) restricted meetings, held for a specific purpose and under exceptional circumstances: essential Secretariat staff, and such others as may be decided by the Board.

AGENDA  Rule    The Director-General shall draw up a draft provisional agenda for each  session of the Board, which shall be circulated to Member States and  Associate Members within four weeks after the closure of its previous session.  Any proposal for the inclusion on the agenda of any item under (c), (d)  and (e) of Rule   shall reach the Director-General not later than    weeks  after circulation of the draft provisional agenda or    weeks before  commencement of the session, whichever is earlier.  The provisional agenda of each session shall be drawn up by the Director- General in consultation with the Officers of the Board, on the basis of the  draft provisional agenda and any proposals received under the second  paragraph of this Rule.  * Please note that Rule   has been amended in accordance with decision  EB   (  ) (    ).      BASIC DOCUMENTS  Where the Director-General and the Officers find it necessary to  recommend the deferral or exclusion of proposals received under the second  paragraph of this Rule, the provisional agenda shall contain an explanation  for such recommendation.  An annotated provisional agenda, together with any recommendations  referred to in the fourth paragraph of this Rule shall be dispatched with the  notice of convocation to be sent in accordance with Rule   or Rule  , as the  case may be.  Rule    Except in the case of sessions convened under Rule  , and subject to Rule   , the provisional agenda of each session shall include, inter alia:  (a) all items the inclusion of which has been ordered by the Health Assembly; (b) all items the inclusion of which has been ordered by the Board at a previous session; (c) any item proposed by a Member State or Associate Member of the Organization; (d) subject to such preliminary consultation as may be necessary between the Director-General and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, any item proposed by the United Nations; (e) any item proposed by any specialized agency with which the Organization has entered into effective relations; and (f) any item proposed by the Director-General. Any proposal for inclusion on the agenda of any item under (c), (d), (e) and (f) above shall be accompanied by an explanatory memorandum, except  in the case of standing or recurring items proposed by the Director-General  under (f).  Rule     Except in the case of special sessions convened under Rule  , any  authority referred to in Rule   may propose one or more additional items of  an urgent nature for inclusion in a supplementary provisional agenda after the  deadline referred to in the second paragraph of Rule   and before the opening  day of the session. Any such proposal shall be accompanied by a supporting  statement from the authority initiating it. The Director-General shall include  any such item in a supplementary provisional agenda which the Board shall  examine together with the provisional agenda.  RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD       Rule     The Board, subject to its constitutional mandate and having regard to the  resolutions and decisions of the Health Assembly, shall adopt its agenda at  the opening meeting of each session on the basis of the provisional agenda,  together with any supplement thereto. In adopting its agenda, the Board may  decide to add to, delete from, or amend, the provisional agenda and any  supplement thereto.  Rule     The Board shall not proceed, unless it determines otherwise, to the  discussion of any item on the agenda until at least    hours have elapsed after  the relevant documents have been made available to the members.  OFFICERS OF THE BOARD  Rule     The Board shall elect its Officers, viz. a Chair, four Vice-Chairs and one  Rapporteur, from among its members each year at its first session after the  Health Assembly, following a principle of rotation among geographical  regions. These Officers shall hold office until their successors are elected.  The Chair shall not become eligible for re-election until two years have  elapsed since he or she ceased to hold office.  Rule     In addition to exercising such powers as are conferred upon her or him  elsewhere by these Rules, the Chair shall declare the opening and closing of  each meeting of the Board, shall direct the discussions, accord the right to  speak, put questions, announce decisions and ensure the application of these  Rules. The Chair shall accord to speakers the right to speak in the order of  their requests. He or she may call to order any speaker whose remarks are  irrelevant to the subject under discussion.  Rule     If the Chair is absent from a meeting or any part thereof, he or she shall  designate one of the Vice-Chairs to preside. The same procedure shall be  followed when the Chair is unable to attend a session of the Board.  If the Chair is unable to make this designation, the Board shall elect one  of the Vice-Chairs to preside during the session or meeting.       BASIC DOCUMENTS  Rule     The Chair, or a Vice-Chair acting as Chair, shall not vote, but he or she  may, if necessary, appoint an alternate from her or his delegation in  accordance with Rule   .  Rule     If the Chair for any reason is unable to complete her or his term of office,  the Board shall elect a new Chair for the remaining period of her or his term.  If the Chair is unable to act in between sessions, one of the Vice-Chairs  shall act in her or his place. The order in which the Vice-Chairs shall be  requested to serve shall be determined by lot at the session at which the  election takes place.  COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD  Rule     The Board may establish such committees as it may deem necessary for  the study of, and reporting on, any item on its agenda. Standing committees  established by the Board shall be composed of members of the Board or their  alternates (referred to in these Rules as “committees of limited membership”).  All Member States and Associate Members shall have the right to attend such  committees in accordance with Rule  . All committees other than standing  committees shall be open-ended, composed of all interested Member States  of the Organization (referred to in these Rules as “open-ended committees”),  unless the Board decides otherwise, for a specific purpose and under  exceptional circumstances.  The composition of committees of limited membership shall be  determined by the Board, after hearing any proposals made by the Chair,  respecting the principles of equitable geographical representation, gender  balance and balanced representation of developing and developed countries  and countries in transition, having regard to the membership of the Board.  In committees of limited membership, the Chairs and all other officers  deemed necessary shall be determined by the Board or, in the absence thereof,  by the committees themselves, respecting the principles of equitable  geographical representation, gender balance and balanced representation of  developing and developed countries and countries in transition. The Chair  and officers shall rotate regularly between regions and, wherever applicable,  between developed and developing countries and countries in transition  within the regions.  In open-ended committees, the Chairs and any other officer deemed  necessary shall be determined by the Board or, in the absence thereof, by the  RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD       committees themselves, respecting the principles of equitable geographical  representation, gender balance and balanced representation of developing and  developed countries and countries in transition.  The Board shall review from time to time the need to maintain any  committee established under its authority.  Rule     Subject to any decision of the Board, and as provided in these Rules, the  procedure governing the conduct of business and voting in committees  established by the Board shall conform as far as practicable to the Rules  relating to the conduct of business and voting in plenary meetings of the  Board. Open-ended committees shall conduct their business on the basis of  consensus. In the event of an inability to reach consensus, the difference of  views shall be reported to the Board.  In the case of committees of limited membership, a majority of the  members shall constitute a quorum.  No distinction in terms of rights of participation in open-ended  committees shall be made between members of the Board and Member States  not represented on the Board.  SECRETARIAT  Rule     The Director-General shall be ex officio Secretary of the Board and of  any subdivision thereof. He or she may delegate these functions.  Rule     The Director-General shall report to the Board on the technical,  administrative and financial implications, if any, of all agenda items  submitted to the Board.  Rule     The Director-General or a member of the Secretariat designated by her or  him may at any time make either oral or written statements concerning any  question under consideration.       BASIC DOCUMENTS  Rule     The Secretariat shall prepare summary records of the meetings. These  summary records shall be prepared in the working languages and shall be  distributed to the members as soon as possible after the close of the meetings  to which they relate. Members shall inform the Secretariat in writing of any  corrections they wish to have made, within such period of time as shall be  indicated by the Director-General, having regard to the circumstances.  Rule     Reports of each session of the Board, containing all resolutions,  recommendations and other formal decisions, as well as the summary records  of the Board and of its committees, shall be communicated by the Director- General to all Member States and Associate Members of the Organization.  Such reports shall also be submitted to the subsequent Health Assembly so  that it may take such action as appropriate, for information, endorsement or  approval, having regard to the respective functions of the Health Assembly  and of the Board as set forth in the Constitution.  LANGUAGES   Rule     Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish shall be both the  official and the working languages of the Board.  Rule     Speeches made in an official language shall be interpreted into the other  official languages in all meetings of the Board and of committees established  by it.  Rule     Any member, or representative of a State Member or of an Associate  Member, or of an invited non-Member State may speak in a language other  than the official languages. In this case he or she shall herself or himself  provide for interpretation into one of the working languages. Interpretation  into the other working languages by interpreters of the Secretariat may be  based on the interpretation given in the first working language.  _________    See resolution WHA  .   (    ).  RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD       Rule     All resolutions, recommendations and other formal decisions of the Board  shall be made available in the working languages.  CONDUCT OF BUSINESS  Rule     Two thirds of the members of the Board shall constitute a quorum.  Rule     A member may at any time request her or his alternate designated in  accordance with Article    of the Constitution to speak and vote on her or his  behalf on any question. Moreover, upon the request of the member or her or  his alternate, the Chair may allow an adviser to speak on any particular point  and, in the absence of the member or her or his alternate, if so requested in  writing by the member or her or his alternate, to speak and vote on any  question.  The Board may limit the time allowed to each speaker.  Rule     Rule     Proposals for resolutions or decisions to be considered by the Board  relating to items of the agenda should be introduced at least    days before  the opening of the session and may, in any event, be introduced not later than  the close of the first day of the session. However, if a session is scheduled for  two days or less, such proposals may be introduced no later than    hours  prior to the opening of the session. The Board may, if it deems it appropriate,  permit the late introduction of such proposals.       BASIC DOCUMENTS  Rule     Proposals and amendments related to items on the agenda shall normally  be introduced in writing and handed to the Director-General, who shall  circulate copies to the delegations. Except as may be decided otherwise by  the Board, no proposal shall be discussed or put to the vote at any meeting of  the Board unless copies of it have been circulated to all delegations at least     hours previously. The Chair may, however, permit the discussion and  consideration of amendments, even though they have not been circulated or  have only been circulated the same day.  Rule     During the discussion of any matter, a member may rise to a point of order,  and the point of order shall be immediately decided by the Chair. A member  may appeal against the ruling of the Chair, in which case the appeal shall  immediately be put to the vote. A member rising to a point of order may not  speak on the substance of the matter under discussion but on the point of order  only.  Rule     During the course of a debate the Chair may announce the list of speakers  and, with the consent of the Board, declare the list closed. He or she may,  however, accord the right of reply to any member if in her or his opinion a  speech delivered after he or she has declared the list closed makes it desirable.  Rule     The right of reply shall be accorded by the Chair to any member who  requests it. Members should, in exercising this right, attempt to be as brief as  possible and preferably deliver their statements at the end of the meeting at  which this right is requested.  Rule     The following motions shall have precedence in the following order over  all other proposals or motions before the meeting, except a point of order:  (a) to suspend the meeting; (b) to adjourn the meeting; (c) to adjourn the debate on the item under discussion; and (d) for the closure of the debate on the item under discussion. RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD       Rule     Subject to Rule   , any motion calling for a decision on the competence  of the Board to adopt a proposal submitted to it shall be put to the vote before  a vote is taken on the proposal in question.  Rule     During the discussion on any matter, a member may move the suspension  or the adjournment of the meeting or the suspension of the debate. Such  motions shall not be debated, but shall immediately be put to a vote. For the  purpose of these Rules “suspension of the meeting” means the temporary  cessation of the business of the meeting, “adjournment of the meeting” means  the termination of all business until another meeting is called, and  “suspension of the debate” means the postponement of further discussion on  the matter under discussion until later in the same session.  Rule     During the discussion of any matter, a member may move the  adjournment of the debate on the item under discussion. In addition to the  proposer of the motion, one speaker may speak in favour of, and one against,  the motion, after which the motion to adjourn the debate shall be immediately  put to the vote.  Rule     A member may at any time move the closure of the debate on the item  under discussion whether or not any other member has signified her or his  wish to speak. If request is made for permission to speak against closure, it  may be accorded to not more than two speakers, after which the motion shall  be immediately put to the vote. If the Board decides in favour of closure the  Chair shall declare the debate closed. The Board shall thereafter vote only on  the one or more proposals moved before the closure.  Rule     A member may move that parts of a proposal or of an amendment shall  be voted on separately. If objection is made to the motion for division, the  motion for division shall be voted upon. Permission to speak on the motion  for division shall be given only to two speakers in favour and two speakers  against. If the motion for division is carried, those parts of the proposal or of  the amendment which are separately approved shall subsequently be put to  the vote as a whole. If all operative parts of the proposal or the amendment       BASIC DOCUMENTS  have been rejected, the proposal or the amendment shall be considered to  have been rejected as a whole.  Rule     When an amendment to a proposal is moved, the amendment shall be  voted on first. When two or more amendments are moved to a proposal, the  Board shall first vote on the amendment deemed by the Chair to be furthest  removed in substance from the original proposal and then on the amendment  next removed therefrom, and so on, until all the amendments have been put  to the vote. Where, however, the adoption of one amendment necessarily  implies the rejection of another amendment, the latter amendment shall not  be put to the vote. If one or more amendments are adopted the amended  proposal shall then be voted upon.  A motion is considered an amendment to a proposal, if it merely adds to,  deletes from, or revises part of that proposal. A motion which constitutes a  substitution for a proposal shall be considered as a proposal.  Rule     If two or more proposals are moved, the Board shall, unless it decides  otherwise, vote on the proposals in the order in which they have been  circulated to all delegations, unless the result of a vote on a proposal makes  unnecessary any other voting on the proposal or proposals still outstanding.  Rule     A motion may be withdrawn by its proposer at any time before voting on  it has commenced, provided that the motion has not been amended or, if  amended, that the proposer of the amendment agrees to the withdrawal. A  motion thus withdrawn may be reintroduced by any member.  Rule     When a proposal has been adopted or rejected it may not be reconsidered  at the same session unless the Board, by a two-thirds majority of the members  present and voting, so decides. Permission to speak on a motion to reconsider  shall be accorded only to two speakers opposing the motion, after which it  shall be immediately put to the vote.  RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD       Rule     The Chair may at any time require any proposal, motion, resolution, or  amendment to be seconded.  VOTING  Rule     Each member of the Board shall have one vote. For the purpose of these  Rules, the phrase “members present and voting” means members casting a  valid affirmative or negative vote. Members abstaining from voting shall be  considered as not voting.  Rule     Decisions by the Board on important questions shall be made by a  two-thirds majority of the members present and voting. These questions shall  include:  (a) recommendations on: (i) the adoption of conventions and agreements, (ii) the approval of agreements bringing the Organization into relation with the United Nations and intergovernmental organizations and agencies in accordance with Articles   ,    and    of the Constitution, (iii) amendments to the Constitution, (iv) the effective working budget, and (v) suspension of the voting privileges and services of a Member State under Article   of the Constitution; and (b) decisions to suspend or amend these Rules of Procedure. Except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the Organization, or decided by the Health Assembly, or laid down in these Rules, the decisions  of the Board on other questions, including the determination of additional  questions to be decided by a two-thirds majority, shall be made by a majority  of the members present and voting.  Rule     If the votes are equally divided on a matter other than an election the  proposal shall be regarded as not adopted.  Rule     The Board shall normally vote by show of hands, except that any member  may request a recorded vote. Where an appropriate electronic system is       BASIC DOCUMENTS  available, the Board may decide to conduct any vote under this Rule by  electronic means.  Rule     When the Executive Board conducts a recorded vote without using  electronic means, the vote shall be conducted through a roll-call, which shall  be taken in the alphabetical order of the names of the members. The name of  the member to vote first shall be determined by lot.  Rule     The vote of each member participating in a recorded vote shall be inserted  in the records.  Rule     After the Chair has announced the beginning of voting, no member shall  interrupt the voting except on a point of order in connexion with the actual  conduct of voting.  Rule     After the voting has been completed, a member may make a brief statement,  consisting solely of an explanation of vote. A sponsor of a proposal shall not  speak in explanation of vote thereon, except if it has been amended.  Rule     Elections shall normally be held by secret ballot. Except as concerns the  nomination of the Director-General and the appointment of the Regional  Directors, and in the absence of any objection the Board may decide to  proceed without taking a ballot on an agreed candidate or list of candidates.  Where a ballot is required, two tellers appointed by the Chair from among the  members present shall assist in the counting of votes.  The nomination of the Director-General shall be decided by secret ballot  in accordance with Rule   .  Subject to Article    of the Constitution, the appointment of a Regional  Director shall be for five years and he or she shall be eligible for  reappointment once only.  Rule     In addition to the cases provided for elsewhere by these Rules the Board  may vote on any matter by secret ballot if it has previously so decided by a  RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD       majority of the members present and voting, provided that no secret ballot  may be taken on budgetary questions.  A decision under this Rule by the Board whether or not to vote by secret  ballot may only be taken by a show of hands; if the Board has decided to vote  on a particular question by secret ballot, no other mode of voting may be  requested or decided upon.  Rule     Subject to the provisions of Rule   , when only one elective place is to  be filled and no candidate obtains in the first ballot the majority required, a  second ballot shall be taken which shall be restricted to the two candidates  obtaining the largest number of votes; if in the second ballot the votes are  equally divided, the Chair shall decide between the candidates by drawing  lots.  Rule     When two or more elective places are to be filled at one time under the  same conditions, those candidates obtaining in the first ballot the majority  required shall be elected. If the number of candidates obtaining such majority  is less than the number of places to be filled, there shall be additional ballots  to fill the remaining places, the ballots being restricted to the candidates  obtaining the greatest number of votes in the previous ballot to a number not  more than twice the places remaining to be filled.  Rule     In an election each member, unless he or she abstains, shall vote for that  number of candidates equal to the number of elective places to be filled. Any  ballot paper on which there are more or fewer names than there are elective  places to be filled shall be null and void.  Rule     If during an election one or more elective places cannot be filled by reason  of an equal number of votes having been obtained by two or more candidates,  a ballot shall be held among such candidates to determine which of them will  be elected. This procedure may be repeated if necessary.  * Rule     At least nine months before the date fixed for the opening of a session of  the Board at which a nomination for the post of Director-General has to take  * Please note that Rule    has been amended in accordance with decision EB   (  ) (    ).      BASIC DOCUMENTS  place, the Director-General shall inform Member States that they may  propose persons for nomination by the Board for the post of Director-General.  Any Member State may propose for the post of Director-General one or  more persons, submitting with the proposal the curriculum vitae or other  supporting information for each person. Such proposals shall be sent under  confidential sealed cover to the Chair of the Executive Board, care of the  World Health Organization in Geneva (Switzerland), so as to reach the  headquarters of the Organization not less than four months before the date  fixed for the opening of the session.  The Chair of the Board shall open the proposals received sufficiently in  advance of the session so as to ensure that all proposals, curricula vitae and  supporting information are translated into all official languages, duplicated  and dispatched to all Member States three months before the date fixed for  the opening of the session.  Immediately after the dispatch to Member States of the proposals,  curricula vitae and supporting information, the Director-General shall, in  consultation with the Chair of the Board, convene a candidates’ forum open  to all Member States and Associate Members, to which all candidates will be  invited to make themselves and their vision known to Member States on an  equal basis. The candidates’ forum shall be chaired by the Chair of the Board  and shall be held not later than two months before the opening of the session.  The Board shall decide on the modalities of the candidates’ forum. The  candidates’ forum shall not be convened in case only one person has been  proposed for the post of Director-General.  If no proposals have been received by the deadline referred to in the  second paragraph of this Rule, the Director-General shall immediately inform  all Member States of this fact and that they may propose persons for  nomination in accordance with this Rule, provided such proposals reach the  Chair of the Board at least two weeks prior to the date fixed for the opening  of the session of the Board. The Chair shall inform Member States of all such  proposals as soon as possible.  All members of the Board shall have the opportunity to participate in an  initial screening of all candidatures in order to eliminate those candidates not  meeting the criteria proposed by the Board and approved by the Health  Assembly.  The Board shall decide, by a mechanism to be determined by it,  underscoring the paramount importance of professional qualifications and  integrity and paying due regard to equitable geographical representation and  gender balance, on a short list of candidates. This short list shall be drawn up  at the commencement of its session, and the selected candidates shall be  interviewed by the Board meeting as a whole as soon as possible thereafter.  The interviews should consist of a presentation by each selected candidate  in addition to answers to questions from members of the Board. If necessary,  RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD       the Board may extend the session in order to hold the interviews and make  its selection.  The Board shall fix a date for the meeting at which it shall nominate three  persons by secret ballot from among the candidates on the short list. In  exceptional circumstances where the nomination of three candidates is not  practicable such as where there are only one or two candidates, the Board  may decide to nominate fewer than three candidates.  For the purpose of nominating three candidates, each member of the  Board shall write on her or his ballot paper the names of three candidates,  chosen from the short list. Those candidates obtaining in the first ballot the  majority required shall be elected. If the number of candidates obtaining such  majority is less than the number of places to be filled, the candidate having  received the least number of votes shall be eliminated at each ballot. If two  candidates tie for the least number of votes, a separate ballot shall be held  between them and the candidate receiving the least number of votes shall be  eliminated. The same mechanism shall apply, mutatis mutandis, when the  Board decides to nominate fewer than three candidates.  The name of the person or persons so nominated shall be announced at a  public meeting of the Board and submitted to the Health Assembly.  SUSPENSION AND AMENDMENT OF RULES OF PROCEDURE  Rule     Subject to the provisions of the Constitution and having regard to any  relevant decisions of the Health Assembly, any of these Rules may be  suspended by the Board in accordance with Rule   , provided that at least     hours’ notice of the proposal for such suspension has been given to the Chair  and communicated by her or him to the members    hours before the meeting  at which the proposal is to be submitted. If, however, on the advice of the  Chair the Board is unanimously in favour of such a proposal, it may adopt it  immediately and without notice. Any such suspension shall be limited to a  specific purpose and to a period required to achieve that purpose.  Rule     Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the Board may amend or  supplement these Rules.       BASIC DOCUMENTS  GENERAL PROVISIONS  Rule     The Board may at its discretion apply such Rules of Procedure of the  Health Assembly as it may deem appropriate to particular circumstances for  which provision does not exist in these Rules.  ––––––––––            ANNEXES  Annex    MEMBERS OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION  (at    May     )  The Members and Associate Members of the World Health Organization  are listed below, with the date on which each became a party to the  Constitution or the date of admission to associate membership.
